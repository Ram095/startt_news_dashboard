Announcing The D2C & Retail Summit — Shaping The Future Of New Commerce In India...,https://inc42.com/buzz/announcing-the-d2c-retail-summit-shaping-the-future-of-new-commerce-in-india/,https://inc42.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75/https://asset.inc42.com/2025/06/Feature-1-1-490x367.jpg,Team Inc42,"10th June, 2025",News,The sixth edition of Inc42’s most anticipated D2C summit is taking place on July 25 in Gurugram to spotlight the rise of new commerce.,"Driven by the spending power of 190 Mn+ online shoppers, India’s D2C ecosystem is undergoing a rapid transformation, rewriting what scale, loyalty, and distribution look like in 2025. From a VC funding lens, India’s D2C sector closed 2024 with $595 Mn, which has already been outpaced by the momentum of 2025. Just a few months into the year, some of the largest deals in the ecosystem have taken shape. Drools became the first Indian pet care company to enter the unicorn club. In another landmark deal, HUL acquired skincare brand Minimalist for INR 2,955 Cr. On the funding front, fashion label Snitch raised $40 Mn, Farmley and Foxtale secured $40 Mn and $30 Mn respectively, while Pilgrim brought in $23.3 Mn, signalling strong investor appetite across categories. ​​Whether through FAST42 Ranking or D2CX, Inc42 has been a driving force behind India’s D2C boom — spotlighting breakout brands and backing founders at every stage, from hands-on learning for early-stage entrepreneurs to curated retreats for growth-stage leaders. A key pillar of our efforts is The D2C Summit, which has grown from a virtual gathering in 2021 to a high-conviction in-person summit by 2024. In 2025, we are back, but as the D2C &amp; Retail Summit. Why The Shift From D2C To D2C &amp; Retail? As consumer behaviour evolves, the lines between digital-first D2C brands and traditional retail are fading fast. Digital-first brands like Mamaearth, Plum, and Snitch have gone beyond D2C — expanding into brand outlets, kiranas, and modern trade formats. At the same time, legacy giants like Tata, Reliance, and Marico are borrowing from the D2C playbook — embracing agile GTM strategies, influencer-led marketing, and hyper-personalised CX, while also backing new-age brands through strategic investments and acquisitions. Scheduled for July 25 at The Oberoi, Gurugram, The D2C &amp; Retail Summit 2025 will bring together 300 handpicked D2C and retail industry leaders, investors and ecosystem enablers under one roof to shape the next phase of new commerce in India. The New Commerce Era Is Here According to Inc42 estimates, India’s D2C market is projected to cross $300 Bn by 2030, making up 75% of the country’s $400 Bn ecommerce opportunity. This growth is no longer defined by whether a brand is digital or physical — it’s about how effectively it integrates both. Even Gen Z, India’s most digital-native generation, is hybrid in behaviour. While they rely on quick commerce platforms like Zepto, Blinkit, and Instamart for convenience, they also actively seek in-store experiences in categories like personal care, groceries, and home products. Studies suggest that nearly 50% of Gen Z prefers offline in these verticals. That’s why omnichannel is no longer optional, it’s the default growth strategy. It unlocks multiple revenue streams, boosts brand recall, and allows brands to scale across Tier II–IV markets and international shelves. But winning here demands more than distribution muscle — it needs tech-first execution. Forward-thinking brands are already tapping AI and real-time data to build intelligent discovery journeys, manage inventory, and create high-retention experiences across channels. As D2C and retail converge, new commerce is emerging as the next operating system for Indian retail — one where tech, capital, consumer intelligence, and distribution intersect. Supported by the likes of Shadowfax, Simpl, Peak XV and Rukam Capital, the D2C &amp; Retail Summit 2025, Inc42 will spotlight this evolution — decoding how new-age brands can scale smarter, faster, and deeper by building for both Bharat and the global consumer. What To Expect At The D2C &amp; Retail Summit Instead of broad, thematic discussions, this year’s summit is built around practical insight and operator-led narratives — designed for founders, CXOs, who are actively shaping India’s commerce infrastructure.   Here’s what makes this edition worth tuning into: Beyond Vanity Panels: Expect 15+ sessions where the focus is on challenges, playbooks, and trade-offs — whether it’s scaling from 0 to 100 stores, managing cash-efficient omnichannel rollouts, or integrating AI into personalisation and inventory. Contrasting Perspectives: With a mix of new-age D2C disruptors and traditional retail giants on stage, attendees will get a rare window into how the two worlds are learning from (and competing with) each other. Think founders of breakout brands sharing stage time with heads of retail at legacy conglomerates. Insights Backed By Execution: The speaker lineup features 40+ leaders across D2C brands, quick commerce players, retail conglomerates, and investors — people who are not just predicting trends but actively executing at scale. Curated Interactions: The invite-only format will enable closed-door interactions, peer learning, and strategic conversations that don’t get drowned out by scale. Learning That Sticks: From understanding unit economics of omnichannel GTM to decoding what Tier II–IV consumers want in 2025, the summit’s goal is to equip attendees with actionable frameworks — not generic foresight. And everything else about navigating the complexity that follows scale for India’s retail brands — from hiring and offline distribution to brand building, retention, and sustainable growth. Whether you're scaling a D2C brand or transforming a retail legacy, this is your chance to be in the room where the future of Indian commerce is being written. As we officially unveil the D2C &amp; Retail Summit 2025, attendee applications are already pouring in. With limited spots available, this is your chance to secure a seat at the industry's most influential gathering. Don’t miss out."
BYJU’S-Owned US Firms Sold At Knockdown Prices,https://inc42.com/buzz/byjus-owned-us-firms-sold-at-knockdown-prices/,https://inc42.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75/https://asset.inc42.com/2025/06/byjus-claims-featured-490x367.jpg,Kartikay K.,"10th June, 2025",Edtech,Tynker and Epic! bought by BYJU’S in US were sold off by the group of lenders who had sued it for a repayment of $1.2 Bn term loan.,"Two edtech firms bought by BYJU’S during its US stint were reportedly sold off by the group of lenders who had sued it for a repayment of $1.2 Bn term loan B (TLB). In a bid to settle accounts, both these subsidiaries Tynker and Epic! were sold at a massive haircut. While Tynker was bought by computer science learning platform CodeHS for $2.2 Mn in a cash deal, which is almost a 99% reduction from $200 Mn paid by BYJU’S when it acquired the coding platform back in 2021, Epic! was snapped up by Chinese education company TAL Education Group at a steep discount of 81% for $95 Mn. BYJU’S doled out $500 Mn while acquiring Epic! in 2021, An EdWeek Brief Market report said that the acquisitions were approved by US bankruptcy court Judge Brendan Shannon in a May 20 hearing. The deal is a part of the Bengaluru-based BYJU’S $1 Bn expansion plan in the US. Founded in 2013 by Suren Markosian and Kevin Donahue, Epic! provides kids and their parents access to books and quizzes so that children could learn from anywhere. While Tynker, founded in 2012, is a K-12 creative coding platform that enables students to develop coding skills to design and power animations, games, music, robots and drones, smart devices, virtual worlds and more. The above fire sales were part of BYJU’S bankruptcy process in the US which involved an unpaid term loan of $1.2 Bn. According to Inc42’s analysis, the edtech major had been on an acquisition spree in the year 2021. In fact, between 2017 and 2021, BYJU’S made 17 buyouts and spent about $3 Bn to expand its edtech empire. Back then, the startup cited product line and user base expansions behind these acquisitions. BYJU’S US Bankruptcy Saga At the heart of the fire sale of Epic! And Tynker is BYJU’S bankruptcy case against the edtech company. BYJU’S Alpha, a bankrupt US-based subsidiary of the edtech company had faltered on paying back a term loan of $1.2 Bn which was facilitated by 37 different credit institutions. Due to mounting losses and freefall in revenues, BYJU’S could not pay back its loans and its US lenders dragged the company to court. Besides, it also surfaced that out of the term loan, BYJU’s had made fraudulent transfers of $533 Mn to Camshaft Fund. In March, A US bankruptcy court ruled in favour of the lenders of BYJU’S in connection with the above case. It is pertinent to note that while the foregone edtech major had invested $700 Mn for acquiring Tynker and Epic!, the liquidation process part of the bankruptcy proceedings could only fetch a little more than $97 Mn. BYJU’S is also facing insolvency proceedings in India and recently the brother of BYJU’S cofounder Byju Raveendran’s and former director of the edtech Riju Raveendran moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking the removal of its US-based lenders from the committee of the creditors."
"Semicon Push: Kaynes, L&T Arm To Buy Fujitsu’s Power Modules Biz",https://inc42.com/buzz/semicon-push-kaynes-lt-arm-to-buy-fujitsus-power-modules-biz/,https://inc42.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75/https://asset.inc42.com/2025/06/semiconductor-490x367.jpg,Amit Singh,"10th June, 2025",News,Kaynes Semicon and L&T Semiconductor Technologies are set to acquire the power modules business of Japan’s Fujitsu for INR 118 Cr.,"Kaynes Semicon and L&amp;T Semiconductor Technologies (LTSTC) are set to acquire the power modules business of Japan’s Fujitsu General Electronics for INR 118.32 Cr (around $13.8 Mn). As part of the deal, Fujitsu will transfer its power modules business to LTSTC, the fabless chip company of Larsen &amp; Toubro, and transfer the related production facilities to Kaynes Semicion, a subsidiary of electronics manufacturing company Kaynes Technologies, which is setting up INR 3,300 Cr semiconductor manufacturing unit in Gujarat’s Sanand. Fujitsu is involved in developing, manufacturing, and selling electronic devices and manufacturing equipment for information and communications in the tech solution business. In India, the Japanese tech titan houses a research facility named Fujitsu Research of India Pvt Ltd (FRIPL). The centre was set up in 2022 in Bengaluru to strengthen its R&amp;D capabilities in AI, machine learning and quantum software. “The company has decided to transfer the business as part of a portfolio transformation of the electronic device business in line with strengthening the company group’s business foundations,” Fujitsu said in a statement yesterday. Meanwhile, Kaynes Semicon is set to emerge as a new major player in the power electronics supply chain following the deal, which is expected to finalise on June 23. This move will establish the Bengaluru-based company as a significant new player, according to its CEO, Raghu Panicker, as reported by ET. Panicker stated that the company's new OSAT (outsourced semiconductor assembly and test) facility in Sanand will kick off operations by concentrating on the global power device packaging market. He further explained that this venture is backed by two crucial elements: a multi-million-dollar, high-volume service agreement with customer Alpha and Omega Semiconductor (AOS) and the acquisition of three power packaging lines from Fujitsu Electronics Ltd Japan. The collaboration with AOS will involve core power devices such as IGBTs, power modules, and MOSFETs, with an anticipated annual production of approximately 670 million units. Additionally, the acquired Fujitsu technology will immediately provide the capability to produce high-reliability automotive and industrial-grade power modules, adding about 0.6 million units to their monthly production capacity. India’s Semiconductor Ambitions It is to be noted that Kaynes Semicon is one of the four companies building semiconductor units in the country under the India Semiconductor Mission 1.0. In September last year, the Centre approved Kaynes’ proposal to set up a semiconductor unit in Sanand in Gujarat that will see an initial investment of INR 3,300 Cr. Once operationalised, the facility will have a capacity of 60 Lakh chips a day. Earlier, it was reported that Kaynes Semicon is planning to deliver India’s first packaged semiconductor chip by July 2025. Earlier this week, the Union government also approved the proposals of US-based Micron Semiconductor and IPO-bound Aequs to set up special economic zones to boost semiconductor and electronics manufacturing in the country. These developments come amid increasing demand for semiconductors in the country, which is being fueled by rising demand for consumer electronic devices and emerging sectors such as AI and electric vehicles. As per MeitY secretary S Krishnan, India’s semiconductor demand is expected to reach $100-110 Bn by 2030 from the current demand of $45–50 Bn. In March, Krishnan also said that the second phase of India Semiconductor Mission is currently in the works. Semicon 2.0 will ensure that designing, manufacturing and packaging semiconductor chips move up the value chain and that made-in-India products find a ready market, he said then. To further embolden India’s position as a semiconductor manufacturing hub, the Centre greenlit an INR 76,000 Cr incentive plan for the semiconductor industry in 2021. The move widely interpreted as a strategy to lure foreign chip giants to invest and set up operations in the country has yielded positive results so far. US chip giant Micron Technology, which is setting up a $825 Mn semiconductor unit in Gujarat, is set to roll out the first India-made chips in the first half of 2025. Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp has also joined hands with Tata Electronics to establish a semiconductor fabrication plant in Gujarat. The likes of Microsoft, Amazon and Google have also announced billions of dollars of investment in India’s cloud computing and AI infrastructure, which is expected to further bolster demand for semiconductors in the country."

As per the startup’s MCA filing accessed by Inc42, board at Meesho passed a special resolution to convert its name from ‘Meesho Private Limited’ to ‘Meesho Limited’ in their extraordinary general meeting on June 5. The conversion will provide Meesho with increased flexibility in pursuing capital market access and align its corporate structure with regulatory expectations applicable to a company proposing to undertake an IPO, the filing added. The filing further said that although the board has not yet approved or initiated the IPO process, but the company aims to maintain readiness from a regulatory and compliance perspective to enable such an offering when deemed appropriate. This comes over a month after the company renamed its parent entity to align corporate and brand identity. Meesho’s IPO Plan Founded in 2015 by IIT alumni Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal, Meesho is India’s third-largest ecommerce platform by GMV. The company counts DST Partners, Tiger Global Management, Peak XV Partners, Elevation Capital, Facebook and Prosus among its investors. Earlier this month, the SoftBank-backed ecommerce platform received approval from its shareholders for a proposal to issue 411.4 Cr bonus shares ahead of filing its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with markets regulator SEBI. The Bengaluru-based startup is said to be looking to raise nearly $1 Bn through its public listing by the end of 2025. It has picked Morgan Stanley, Kotak Mahindra Capital and Citi as bankers for its IPO. The bankers have reportedly pitched for a $10 Bn valuation for the public issue. Meesho managed to narrow its net loss by 81.8% to INR 304.9 Cr in the financial year 2023-24 (FY24) from INR 1,675 Cr in the previous year. Its operating revenue zoomed 32.8% to INR 7,614.9 Cr in FY24, from INR 5,734.5 Cr, a year ago. Several Indian startups are converting into public entities, including omnichannel eyewear retailer Lenskart, Media-focused SaaS unicorn Amagi, fintech unicorn Pine Labs, and Walmart-owned PhonePe, preparing for IPOs. Many other companies are also planning to go public in the future."

The food delivery experiment came as the company is raising INR 125 Cr from Nexus Venture Partners. It also plans to raise another INR 250 Cr from Dutch investor Prosus. Restaurants Get A Breather? Unlike the incumbent foodtech giants that are well-known for their steep commissions, Ownly will charge restaurants a fixed delivery fee between INR 10 and INR 25 per order. In total, Rapido's fixed pricing structure could cost restaurateurs a paltry 10% to 15% of the order value, compared to up to 35% commission levied by Zomato and Swiggy. What’s In It For Consumers? Ownly has mandated restaurant partners to commit to providing at least four meal options priced below INR 150. A low commission will incentivise food outlets to price their offerings competitively and skip absorbing discounts, which are the norm on Zomato and Swiggy. Rapido Rivals ONDC: While ONDC was initially seen as an alternative to the foodtech titans, the state-backed network has yet to find its footing and has been facing declining retail order volumes and recent leadership exits. However, what works for Rapido is its network effect of over 30 Mn monthly transacting users, a delivery fleet and the promise of transparent pricing. So, can ‘Ownly’ break the Zomato-Swiggy duopoly?

However, there are many missing pieces in Ola’s recovery plans. How Tonbo Built An INR 400 Cr Biz? With a sharp focus on an asset-light model and profitability, Tonbo’s USP lies in designing and building all its tech and products in-house. Banking on this, the company’s core revenue crossed INR 400 Cr in FY25. Can it continue the momentum? Food Safety Violations At Blinkit: The Maharashtra authorities have revoked the food business licence of the quick commerce major’s warehouse in Pune’s Balewadi. This came after an inspection revealed that the dark store lacked the licences to distribute or sell food items. Wakefit Readies For IPO: The D2C mattress brand has turned into a public entity ahead of its IPO as the company’s board passed a resolution to drop the word “Private” from its name. The brand has already shortlisted bankers to helm its INR 2,000 Cr public listing. Shein’s India Playbook: The Chinese fast fashion brand is looking to increase the number of Indian suppliers to 1,000 to sell India-made goods in its overseas markets. Currently, it hosts 7,000 Chinese vendors that supply products to 150 locations globally.

Former ShareChat Executives’ Microdrama App Flick TV Bags $2.3 Mn,https://inc42.com/buzz/former-sharechat-executives-microdrama-app-flick-tv-bags-2-3-mn/,https://inc42.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75/https://asset.inc42.com/2025/06/Flick-TV-Founders-Feature-490x367.png,Anne F.,"10th June, 2025",News,Noida-based microdrama OTT platform Flick TV has raised $2.3 Mn (INR 19.7 Cr) in a seed funding round led by Stellaris Venture Partners,"Noida-based microdrama OTT platform Flick TV has raised $2.3 Mn (INR 19.7 Cr) in a seed funding round led by Stellaris Venture Partners, with participation from Gemba Capital and Titan Capital. Flick TV cofounder and chief executive Kushal Singhal told Inc42 that the fresh proceeds would be deployed to scale up its content production. “The plan is to come up with 100 originals this year, while also launching content in four regional languages.” Additionally, the startup will use the capital to optimise its streaming experience on smartphones and expand team as well as user base. For the uninitiated, microdrama refers to a scripted, serialised story told in extremely short episodes, ranging from 30 seconds to 10 minutes. These episodes are typically optimised for mobile viewing and distributed through platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Pocket FM, Kuku FM and various OTT apps. How Flick TV Is Setting The Narrative In Microdrama Space Launched in April this year by former ShareChat executives Singhal and Sanidhya Mittal, with former Pocket FM senior director Pratik Anand, Flick TV aims to address the gap of narrating stories to audiences who consume enormous amounts of snackable content online. Currently, the startup incubates four production houses to generate content for its audience, Singhal said. On Google Play Store app, Flick TV has more than 10,000 downloads till date. It competes with platforms such as Reelies, Kuku and ReelSaga in the short-form video content space. Singhal further said that the platform is primarily targeting housewives and shopkeepers as its audience, who prefer to consume content across categories such as love, heartbreak, drama, crime, fiction and fantasy. He further added that the app generates its revenue via micropayment model, where users pay a small fee based on the number of episodes they want to watch per day. “And as users develop more trust on the platform, we will switch them to monthly and quarterly payment plans,” he added. Microdrama’s Rising Wave Of Buzz Content has been shaping the consumption habits of users online. OTT platforms have fueled a boom in binge-watching among audiences across various age groups. However, the shrinking attention span of users led to growing user traction for short-form video content, where apps such as YouTube and Instagram practically began observing more traffic in Shorts and Reels, respectively. Short-form video content which initially revolved around categories such as beauty, travel, health, fitness and comedy, is now growing to include entertainment content in the form of episodes. The development comes at a time when investors have been betting on entertainment platforms being built in the microdrama segment to develop new content and boost new trends of consumption today. For instance, ReelSaga raised $2.1 Mn (around INR 17.9 Cr) in a seed funding round about a month ago, to fuel app development and produce high-quality, localised content. The global microdrama market, built on ultra-short, mobile-first fiction, stood at $6.54 Bn in 2024 and is projected to hit nearly $12 Bn by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 10.5%."
"CRED Raises $72 Mn In A Down Round From GIC, Others",https://inc42.com/buzz/cred-raises-72-mn-in-a-down-round-from-gic-others/,https://inc42.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75/https://asset.inc42.com/2025/06/CRED-funding-featured-490x367.png,Akshit P.,"10th June, 2025",Fintech,Kunal Shah-led fintech unicorn CRED has raised INR 617 Cr in a down round led by Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC’s Lathe Investment.,"Kunal Shah-led fintech unicorn CRED has raised INR 617 Cr (about $72 Mn) in a down round led by Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC’s Lathe Investment. In what appears to be a Series G round, the fintech major raised the capital at a valuation of $3.5 Bn, down nearly 45% from $6.4 Bn at which it was last pegged in 2022. As per its filings with the Registrar of Companies (RoC), GIC spearheaded the round with a total investment of INR 354.4 Cr. RTP Capital and Sofina poured INR 74.9 Cr and INR 25.9 Cr, respectively. Meanwhile, founder and CEO Shah-owned investment vehicle QED Innovation Labs invested INR 162.1 Cr in the round. The fundraise comes a couple of months after reports first surfaced that the fintech juggernaut was in talks with investors to raise $100 Mn to $200 Mn from investors, including Peak XV Partners, Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital at a post-money valuation of $4 Bn. As per Economic Times, the fintech major took the hefty valuation cut as it is exploring a potential initial public offering (IPO) in the next two years. CRED clocked $6.4 Bn valuation in 2022 when it bagged $140 Mn in its Series F round. It is pertinent to note that GIC led that round too. Since its last fundraise, the startup has been working aggressively to launch new offerings and bolster its top line despite deepening losses. In FY24, CRED's operating revenue zoomed 71% to INR 2,397 Cr from INR 1,400 Cr in FY23. Meanwhile, losses rose 22% year-on-year (YoY) to INR 1,644 Cr in the fiscal under review. CRED is yet to file its financial results for FY25. Nevertheless, the past one year has seen the startup focussing its energies on expanding its product stack to shore up its super app ambitions. Here's a brief look at what the startup has been up to in recent times: In May 2025, the startup partnered with used-car marketplaces CARS24 and Spinny to enable users to sell their cars on its platform Doubling down on its credit vertical, CRED announced a slew of new offerings such as credit against mutual funds CRED Cash+, credit score checker CRED Credit Score, among others, under ‘Svalbard’ In January 2025, CRED launched CRED e₹ wallet in beta mode in collaboration with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), becoming the first fintech startup to introduce Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) In November 2024, the unicorn entered into the insurtech space in partnership with three insurance companies through its vehicle management platform CRED garage The funding round also comes at a time when big-ticket startups are facing valuation challenges as investors tighten their purse strings. Earlier this month, B2B ecommerce major Udaan closed its Series G funding round at $114 Mn at a likely flat valuation of $1.8 Bn. In April, fintech startup Jar’s $50 Mn funding deal with a clutch of investors, led by Prosus, reportedly collapsed over valuation differences. In March, Temasek-owned Fullerton Financial Holdings acquired a controlling 55.57% stake in Lendingkart for INR 252 Cr, pegging the lending tech startup at a mere $100 Mn as against its peak valuation of $350 Mn in 2020."
"Starlink To Debut Monthly Subscriptions At INR 3,000 In India",https://inc42.com/buzz/starlink-to-debut-monthly-subscriptions-at-inr-3000-in-india/,https://inc42.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75/https://asset.inc42.com/2025/06/starlink-India-featured-2-490x367.png,Team Inc42,"10th June, 2025",News,"Satcom operator Starlink is looking to price its monthly subscriptions in the range of INR 3,000 to INR 4,200.","As Starlink gears up for its India entry, the Elon Musk-owned satellite communication (satcom) operator is reportedly looking to price its monthly subscriptions in the range of INR 3,000 to INR 4,200. Citing sources, Business Standard reported that Starlink kits (which includes a satellite dish and a Wi-Fi router) are expected to cost a steep INR 33,000 in the country. The satcom operator’s hardware will be available at retail outlets of telcos Airtel and Reliance Jio. The two telecom operators struck separate deals to distribute the satcom company’s equipment and services in India. As per the report, the US-based firm’s pricing strategy in India will be similar to other nations in the subcontinent like Bangladesh and Bhutan, where Starlink commenced operations in May and February, respectively. However, the monthly plans for India may cost slightly more than those in underdeveloped African countries like Zimbabwe and Madagascar. The report added that Starlink’s pricing strategy in the country will be dictated by capacity constraints and global costs despite India’s large market size. The sources said that the company does not have much to gain by lowering prices to attract more customers, adding that the offering will remain a premium service given the capacity constraints of the company as it may be able to cater to only about 1 Mn connections in the short to medium term. This is largely in line with what Jefferies said in a note in February this year. The brokerage firm noted that Starlink's current capacity may be able to support 0.18 Mn subscribers in India, which could grow to 5.7 Mn users by 2030, assuming a 30X rise in capacity. Starlink’s India Tryst Starlink currently offers services in more than 125 countries through its constellation of over 7,600 low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. The company reportedly plans to deploy up to 12,000 satellites to complete the constellation. This comes a month after Starlink reportedly received a Letter of Intent (LoI) from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to operate satellite-based internet services in India. It also received a key approval from the telecom ministry to kick off services in the country just days ago. Alongside, the Elon Musk-led company has been looking to sign partnerships with domestic telecom and satcom giants such as Hughes, Tata Group-led Nelco, and state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) to expand its India presence. Nevertheless, regulatory troubles continue to loom over the company. Last month, the telecom department issued a new set of 29 stringent security conditions for acquiring satcom licences including requirements for real-time terminal tracking, local data processing, legal interception capabilities, and localisation. Starlink is said to have agreed to these mandates. Not just this, the government also recently set up a satcom monitoring facility with an outlay of INR 900 Cr as global satcom players make a beeline to enter the Indian market. Besides Starlink, Amazon-backed Project Kuiper has also sought LoI to offer satcom services in the country. The company reportedly plans to set up 10 gateways and two points of presence in Chennai and Mumbai. Then, there is Apple vendor Globalstar, which, too, has sought approval from the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) to launch services in the country."
Zee Invests In Content Startup Bullet To Enter Microdrama Universe,https://inc42.com/buzz/zee-invests-in-content-startup-bullet-to-enter-microdrama-universe/,https://inc42.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75/https://asset.inc42.com/2022/05/ZEE5-Q4-FT-490x367.png,Akshit P.,"9th June, 2025",News,Zee Entertainment has entered into a equity partnership with content startup Bullet to enter the 60-second drama content space,"Amid the growth of microdramas in India, media giant Zee Entertainment is investing in content startup Bullet to enter the 60-second content space. In a statement, Zee said it has entered into a strategic equity partnership with Bullet. However, it didn’t disclose the investment amount or the stake it would acquire in the startup. Bullet was co-founded by ex-Fanory cofounders and media industry veterans Azim Lalani and Saurabh Kushwal in April 2025. Zee said that Bullet has developed India's first microdrama application focussed on fast-paced, creator-driven content through short-duration vertical format episodes. Bullet would be launched within Zee's OTT platform Zee5 in multiple languages and the streaming app would be the host to native stories with ""masala"" plots. In its reasoning to back the startup, the media company said that Bullet has built its platform with a deep focus on creator-led content, gamified experiences, AI-powered personalisation and content pricing. Notably, users cannot access any content on Bullet’s website currently. “Bullet offers a carefully curated library of the best micro-dramas from every genre. Whether you're into thrilling adventures or cultural epics, there's something for everyone,"" Bullet’s website says, along with a ""Coming soon"" icon. As per Kushwal’s LinkedIn profile, the founders are building the startup in “stealth mode”. Lalani and Kushwal earlier cofounded creator monetisation platform Fanory. Founded in 2021 by Manish Maheshwari, former India head of X, and the duo, Fanory operates a content monetisation platform for digital creators. The startup connects creators with fans on the app to leverage and monetise their community of fans. In January 2023, gaming startup JetSynthesys acquired a controlling stake in the startup. Subsequently, all the three cofounders departed from their erstwhile business. While Maheshwari quit Fanory in December 2024 to focus on his early-stage-focussed VC firm BAT VC, Lalani and Kushwal departed from Fanory in March. It is pertinent to mention that the cofounders of Bullet share an extensive background in the media industry. Lalani has over two decades of experience in the industry, and his last media role was as the business head of TV9's Money9. Kushwal was the product head at ABP Network before taking the entrepreneurial plunge. The Growing Indian Affinity For Microdramas With this, Zee has become the first major media company in India to try its hands at microdramas. This type of content, which can be said to be an offspring of OTT shows and Instagram Reels, has seen major traction in China and the US in recent years, with research reports pegging the industry's market size at $6.5 Bn in 2024. This is expected to reach $12 Bn by 2030. In India, experts are of the opinion that the adoption of this type of content is a fairly natural progression, given India's affinity to soap operas and the current short form content obsession. “A surge in India’s mobile-first consumers, our love for dramatic storytelling, and an evolving consumption pattern make this the ideal time to build in this space,"" 360 ONE Asset’s early stage VC head Abhishek Nag told Inc42 last month. Besides Zee, other major studios, production houses, and OTTs have begun experimenting with microdramas. For instance, Amazon-owned MX Player is trying out short movies and series on its platform under the brand name MX Fatafat, and JioStar is now promoting its large format serials in a similar microdrama fashion. Even though the trend is new in India, startups like Reelies, ReelSaga and Kuku TV are operating in the space and are scaling their userbase rapidly."

This marks a 47% increase from the $254 Mn valuation at which the startup last raised capital in 2024. The board of GIVA passed a resolution on May 26 to issue 1.73 Lakh Series C compulsorily convertible preference shares (CCPS) at INR 25,947 per share to raise the aforesaid amount from a group of investors led by Creaegis. The VC firm, through its investment arm CIF II Scheme I, will infuse INR 235 Cr in the new-age jewellery startup. Other participants include existing backers Premji Invest, which will inject INR 125 Cr, and Epiq Capital, which will invest INR 45 Cr. The remaining funds will come from Edelweiss Discovery Fund and Usha Dalmia Trust. GIVA declined to comment on Inc42’s queries on the fundraise, while questions sent to its cofounder Ishendra Agarwal did not elicit any response till the time of publishing the story. Founded in 2019 by Agarwal, Nikita Prasad and Sachin Shetty, GIVA initially sold authentic 925 fine silver jewellery but later diversified into 14K and 18K gold and lab-grown diamond jewellery. Besides its own website, the brand retails its products through physical stores it operates across the country and a shop-in-shop model with Shoppers Stop and other chains. Currently, it operates 199 stores spanning tier I &amp; II cities like Bengaluru, Pune, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi NCR, Ahmedabad, Dehradun, Surat, Indore, among others. Inc42 reported in March that GIVA had secured INR 102 Cr in a mix of equity and debt from Alteria Capital and Northern Arc. At the time, the startup said it would use the funds to open new retail stores and other general corporate purposes. Prior to that, it raised INR 255 Cr in its extended Series B funding round from a group of investors, including Premji Invest, Epiq Capital and Edelweiss Discovery Fund, in October 2024. Overall, GIVA has raised about $102 Mn in funding till date. It also counts Aditya Birla Ventures, Alteria Capital and A91 Partners among its investors. On the financial front, GIVA posted a 66% year-on-year jump in its operating revenue to INR 273.6 Cr in FY24. However, its net loss widened to INR 58.7 Cr from INR 45.2 Cr in the previous year, primarily due to a sharp increase in the cost of procuring metals. GIVA competes with Tata Group-owned CaratLane, Kushal’s, Palmonas, Voylla, among others, in the Indian online jewellery market. Recently, Tiger Global-backed wealthtech startup Jar also launched its D2C jewellery brand Nek. Meanwhile, GIVA’s rival BlueStone is gearing up for a public listing in 2025. Earlier this year, the Prosus-backed omnichannel jewellery startup received approval from markets regulator SEBI for its INR 1,000+ Cr IPO."
