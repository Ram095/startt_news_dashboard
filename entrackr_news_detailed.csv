The report added that these sales were approved by a US bankruptcy court on May 20. Byju&amp;quot;s had acquired Epic for $500 million in 2021 and Tynker for $200 million. The transactions were part of a broader restructuring attempt by Byju&amp;quot;s to address ongoing disputes with lenders and recover from operational missteps and delayed financial disclosures.

For context, Byju&amp;quot;s has yet to file its audited financial report for FY23, FY24 and FY25. Meanwhile, some of the companies acquired by Byju&amp;quot;s, such as Great Learning and Aakash Institute, have distanced themselves from the Bengaluru-based firm, and are operating independently. Queries sent to Byju&amp;quot;s did not elicit an immediate response."

With the fresh funding, Sanlayan plans to increase its engineering headcount fivefold in the next six months. According to the startup, it is actively hiring domain experts, R&amp;amp;D scientists, retired armed forces veterans, and senior leadership from both public sector undertakings and private defence giants. Founded by former Zetwerk employees Abhijit Kothawale, Rohan Gala, and Rahul Vamsidhar, Sanlayan specializes in the design and development of advanced electronic systems, including radar, electronic warfare, and mission-critical avionics. The startup raised $4.4 million in its seed round in March last year from prominent institutional investors, including First Cheque, Gemba Capital, Singularity Ventures, and others. “We will continue to acquire capabilities both organically and inorganically. We are allocating capital for suo-moto development of critical technologies for CUAS and EW systems.

Sanlayan, leveraging its in-house R&amp;amp;D, is also developing AESA radar for India&amp;quot;s unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) program."
"VerSe denies revenue manipulation charges, calls claims baseless and defamatory",https://entrackr.com/news/verse-denies-revenue-manipulation-charges-calls-claims-baseless-and-defamatory-9336820,Kunal Manchanada,2025-06-05,"VerSe has categorically denied allegations of financial impropriety involving Builder.ai, calling them “factually incorrect, baseless, defamatory, and misleading.”","VerSe Innovation, the parent firm of Dailyhunt and Josh, has categorically denied allegations of financial impropriety involving UK-based Builder.ai, calling them “factually incorrect, baseless, defamatory, and misleading.” In a telephonic interview with Entrackr, VerSe&amp;quot;s Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Umang Bedi, dismissed the accusations and shared actual AWS Portal monthly usage backed by monthly invoices from Builder, cloud services historic Jira tickets, custom app development environment proof on Builder Home Portal, 26+ Version releases, 18+ upgrades and patches and ad server campaigns with campaign tracking viewability and CTR metrics along with sample invoices issued to Builder.ai for advertising services. These invoices, the company claims, are part of a fully auditable trail and align with the revenues declared in its financial statements. “Any insinuation that VerSe colluded with Builder.ai to inflate revenues, engaged in reciprocal billing without corresponding services, or manipulated invoicing practices to avoid suspicion is entirely false and irresponsible,” the company said in an official statement. VerSe clarified that over the past five years, it had availed services worth $80 million from Builder.ai, which included AWS infrastructure, cloud services, custom software and application development. These included hyperscaler AWS cloud deployment, system migration, and custom app development. During the same period, Builder.ai engaged VerSe for advertising and promotional services, paying a total of $53 million, creating a clear imbalance in the trade. “All revenues and expenses recorded were for legitimate services rendered and delivered—either directly or through subsidiaries,” the company said, adding that all payments were appropriately received or made and verified by third-party auditors. The company further pointed out that each transaction involving Builder.ai underwent extensive scrutiny during its statutory FY24 audit. “Each such transaction was validated and checked thoroughly,” the company added. The audit concluded with an unmodified opinion, indicating that VerSe&amp;quot;s financials presented a true and fair view in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards. While the auditors flagged some internal control weaknesses in the standalone reporting, VerSe emphasized that this did not impact the financial accuracy of the statements. “These material weaknesses... do not affect our opinion,” the audit report clarified. VerSe stated it reserves the right to pursue legal remedies against those propagating what it deems to be falsehoods. “We operate with transparency and legal compliance, and our records can withstand any examination,” the spokesperson added. With the controversy “behind us,” VerSe said it is now focused on achieving breakeven in H2 FY26, driven by its AI-first product suite—NexVerse.ai, Dailyhunt Premium, Josh Audio Calling &amp;amp; Stories, and VerSe Collab."

"Hyundai, Kia sell Rs 690 Cr Ola Electric stake with majority buyers undisclosed",https://entrackr.com/news/hyundai-kia-sell-rs-690-cr-ola-electric-stake-with-majority-buyers-undisclosed-9333017,Kunal Manchanada,2025-06-04,"Hyundai Motor and Kia Corporation have exited Ola Electric, selling their entire stake in the company for a combined Rs 690 crore via block deals on Tuesday.","Hyundai Motor and Kia Corporation have exited Ola Electric, selling their entire stake in the company for a combined Rs 690 crore via block deals on Tuesday, signaling a strategic pullback from their EV investment in India. Hyundai offloaded its 2.47% stake worth Rs 552 crore, while Kia sold its 0.62% holding for Rs 137 crore, NSE&amp;quot;s bulk deal data shows. The exit comes over five years after the two auto giants, part of the same group, jointly invested $300 million in Ola Electric in 2019. Citigroup Global Markets Mauritius emerged as the key buyer in the transaction, picking up a 1.95% stake (8.61 crore shares) for Rs 435 crore. Curiously, the identities of the other buyers were not disclosed. The stake sale comes on the heels of a weak financial performance by Ola Electric in the last quarter of FY25. The firm reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 862 crore in Q4, more than double the Rs 418 crore loss in Q4 FY24. Its operating revenue fell nearly 50% Y-oY to Rs 611 crore. For the full fiscal year, net loss widened to Rs 2,276 crore from Rs 1,584 crore in FY24. Ola Electric&amp;quot;s shares dropped over 8% to close at Rs 49.61 on Wednesday, bringing its market capitalization down to Rs 21,882 crore ( $2.57 billion). Hyundai and Kia&amp;quot;s exit reduces Ola Electric&amp;quot;s strategic partners, but Citi&amp;quot;s investment shows there is still some investor interest. With losses mounting after going public, the main question is whether Ola Electric can become profitable by FY26. Interestingly, more than 63% of the stakes sold by Hyundai and Kia were bought by investors whose identities have not been made public."
