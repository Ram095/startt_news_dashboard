"With a focus on meals below Rs 150 and offline-equal prices, Rapido’s Ownly is a zero commission food delivery model for Bharat",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/with-a-focus-on-meals-below-rs-150-and-offline-equal-prices-rapido-s-ownly-is-a-zero-commission-food-delivery-model-for-bharat-13107412.html,Unknown,"June 10, 2025 / 16:12","Rapido will aim to take on the long held duopoly enjoyed by Zomato and Swiggy in the online food delivery space. As it happens, Swiggy is an investor in Rapido.","“Every person should have the luxury of choice and the ability to order a reasonably priced meal"" is Rapido’s mission as it firms up plans to enter the food delivery market, with an initial pilot in Bengaluru, and disrupt the duopoly that Zomato and Swiggy have long enjoyed.

According to its pitch to restaurateurs, a copy of which Moneycontrol has reviewed, Rapido is calling its food delivery offering as “Ownly”. While there are chances that the name of the business unit changes closer to time, the company’s goal, of making meals more affordable to consumers, will remain unchanged.

Under the current regime, several restaurant owners have accused Zomato and Swiggy of high commissions, preferential treatment, higher customer acquisition costs (CACs) and more. Together, all of those reasons have forced business owners to look beyond the two companies for a third alternative.

In the past, Coca Cola-backed Thrive attempted food delivery and positioned itself as a challenger but ultimately had to shutter operations as the business failed to take off.

However, there are more options. Government-backed Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), Zomato-funded Magicpin, Zepto Cafe, Blinkit’s Bistro, Swish and more, are all growing but are yet to reach a meaningful scale which will disrupt the Zomato and Swiggy food delivery duopoly.

While Zomato completes over 2.5 million food deliveries each day, Swiggy does over 2 million food deliveries each day. The two companies together account for a 95 percent market share in the food delivery industry which is over $8 billion in size.

However, there are challenger brands emerging.

Rapido, in its pitch, said it enables 4 million rides in 500 Indian cities and has 30 million monthly active users, which positions it as a strong challenger brand, especially given its scale.

Rapido is also playing on another key theme: ensuring that online prices are at par with prices offline. “We will only be looking to work with partners who can commit to this stand of honest pricing,” Rapido said in its proposal.

Rapido plans to do that through zero commissions on food delivery, not allowing restaurants to charge packaging costs separately and not leveraging discounts/advertisements as a push to acquire customers, as per the document.

Essentially, Rapido will introduce minimal layers of costs so restaurants can price products at a more reasonable price.

A significant markup, sometimes even a 40 percent increment, in food prices in the online world has proven to be one of the biggest deterrents for users to order food online.

Rapido, however, promises to change that.

“The price of a dish (excluding GST) is the final price the customer pays. There is no other addition from us or a restaurant partner. Offline price = Online price,” Rapido’s proposal document said.

Rapido will charge a flat delivery fee of Rs 25 plus goods and service tax (GST) for all food orders above Rs 100. However, for all food orders that are Rs 100 and below, the delivery cost will be Rs 20. All of this for a standard 4 kilometre radius.

To be sure, the delivery costs will be borne by the restaurant partners and not the customers. In the initial days at least, customers will not pay any amount apart from the food’s costs plus GST.

Essentially, Rapido will introduce minimal layers of costs so restaurants can price products at a more reasonable price.

Swiggy and Zomato currently have several line items such as platform fee, packaging charges, GST on such costs, delivery fee and more, which cumulatively push up prices.

Rapido, however, intends to do away with all of that. Instead, it will make restaurants pay for the delivery and since it will operate a zero commission model, the restaurants can list food items online without a markup. That way, the customer also gets food at a more affordable price.

But, how will Rapido make money?

While these proposals sound enticing for restaurants and customers, Rapido still has a business to run and will need to make so its monthly cash burn of around $5 million does not increase further.

“We hope to bring delivery costs down across the industry…Once we have brought about real structural change in delivery prices, we will look to charge a flat subscription fee from restaurants. We will always remain zero commission,” Rapido’s proposal said.

The model is similar to the arrangement that Rapido has for its core offering, ride-hailing.

Apart from an eventual subscription model, Rapido will also play the volume game. The company aims to bring on new customers in large numbers so they transact more frequently.

“We believe that food continues to get more expensive online. As a result, a bulk of Bharat has been locked out of using online delivery platforms,” Rapido’s proposal read.

To tap new users and make food more affordable for the existing ones, Rapido has mandated its restaurant partners to list at least four meals that are priced at Rs 150 and below, the document showed.

Rapido is betting that affordable food options will attract more transacting users which will eventually drive up volumes and sales. This is also at odds with incumbent giants, Zomato and Swiggy, which are constantly trying to push up average order values (AOVs).

“Think of us as a low cost platform that is looking to get you a large number of new customers,” the document said.

Rapido will also allow restaurant partners to advertise on its platform, and the company will also share data with restaurants for them to drive marketing campaigns, which will further open up revenue streams for Rapido.

In response to Moneycontrol's queries, a Rapido spokesperson said: ""At Rapido, we are constantly looking at opportunities to scale our services and bring greater convenience to our users. In line with this vision, we are currently test piloting an online food delivery app in the city of Bengaluru.""

""The pilot aims to leverage our strong network of captains while assessing the potential to complement our existing services. It’s an exciting opportunity for us to learn, improve, and see how we can add even more value for our consumers. We’ll share more details on our plans as we move forward,"" the spokesperson added.

As the company gears up for a pilot in Bengaluru over the coming week, restaurant owners are excited about a serious third brand that is emerging as a challenger. However, it remains to be seen if Rapido can successfully change the food delivery landscape and force Swiggy, an investor in Rapido, and Zomato to follow suit or will Rapido eventually take the Zomato Swiggy route, too."
EV tech startup Vecmocon raises $18 million in series A led by Ecosystem Integrity Fund,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/ev-tech-startup-vecmocon-raises-18-million-in-series-a-led-by-ecosystem-integrity-fund-13106517.html,Unknown,"June 09, 2025 / 22:34",,"New Delhi-based clean mobility deeptech startup Vecmocon Technologies has raised $18 million in its Series A funding round led by Ecosystem Integrity Fund (EIF), with participation from Aavishkaar Capital, British International Investment (BII), and existing investor Blume Ventures.

Founded in 2016 by Peeyush Asati, Shivam Wankhede, and Adarshkumar Balaraman, alumni of IIT Kanpur, IIT Delhi, and ISB, respectively.

Vecmocon develops safety-critical electronics and software platforms for electric vehicles (EVs). The company provides products such as battery management systems, vehicle intelligence modules, motor controllers, intelligent chargers, and cloud-based analytics.

The core team has expertise in battery modelling, components design, systems architecture, embedded software, and data science.

The company said the funding will be used to expand market presence, strengthen capabilities in embedded design, power electronics, IoT, and data science, and support deployment across more than 100,000 EVs in India. Part of the capital will also go towards team expansion and the development of international-standard R&D infrastructure for the electric automotive sector.

“This infusion of capital will supercharge our efforts to engineer the next generation of the most robust, high-performance, software-defined, and safety-critical systems uniquely tailored for Indian conditions and global deployment in electric vehicles and clean energy systems,"" Peeyush Asati, Chief Executive Officer, Vecmocon Technologies said.

Vecmocon raised $10 million funding in its first phase of Series A funding, led by the Ecosystem Integrity Fund (EIF), while Blume Ventures and British International Investment (BII) also joined the Series A round. Previously the firm raised $5.2 million from Tiger Global, and Blume Ventures in 2022 as part of their pre-series round.

Devin Whatley, Managing Partner, Ecosystem Integrity Fund, said, “At EIF, we’re thrilled to support Vecmocon as it builds the technical backbone for India’s rapidly expanding EV ecosystem. Its cutting-edge solutions unlock smarter, safer, and more reliable EVs – accelerating the shift to sustainable transportation.”

"Zomato introduces long-distance fee, rider assurance plan for restaurants to boost order margins",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/zomato-introduces-long-distance-fee-rider-assurance-plan-for-restaurants-to-boost-order-margins-13106255.html,Unknown,"June 09, 2025 / 19:15","Zomato's parent, Eternal, has also proposed a new visibility assurance plan for brands where they can pay around Rs 6,000-6,500 each month, for each restaurant identification (RID), and boost rider availability for their business, sources told Moneycontrol.","Eternal, the parent of food delivery giant Zomato, has made it costlier for restaurants to service orders, especially the ones that come from a few kilometres away, as the company looks to make each order more profitable.

Zomato is now asking restaurants to pay the platform an additional ‘long distance fee’ on orders that are delivered beyond 4 kilometres. In its latest communication, a copy of which Moneycontrol has reviewed, restaurants will have to pay Zomato an additional Rs 20 per order in long distance fee if the delivery location is 4-6 kilometres away from the restaurant or cloud kitchen and if the order value is above Rs 150.

If the delivery location is more than 6 kilometres away, the fee is doubled, and restaurants will be required to pay Zomato Rs 40 per order for the same order value.

For smaller orders, that fall in the Rs 0-150 price bracket, restaurants will not have to pay any additional charges if the food is delivered within 6 kilometres.

However, if these small orders are delivered beyond 6 kilometres, Zomato will collect Rs 40 per order from the restaurant, Moneycontrol has learnt.

“Our endeavor is that each order should be profitable for you, and us,” Eternal said in its communication. No such fee was in place earlier.

Four restaurant owners that Moneycontrol spoke with said Eternal has begun making these proposals only in the past few days. The additional fee, which they said will deter them from servicing orders that come from far away, will be rolled out soon.

To be sure, the additional long distance fee will differ slightly for different restaurant partners, depending on their arrangements with Eternal/Zomato.

However, the total amount payable to Zomato, including the latest fee and other components, will be capped at 30 percent of the order value which essentially means no restaurant partner will pay more than 30 percent of the order value in commissions, as per a separate document reviewed by Moneycontrol.

Eternal did not immediately reply to Moneycontrol’s queries.

To be sure, Zomato will levy these additional charges only on its restaurant partners and not on customers, yet. Customers will continue to pay the same delivery fee as they pay currently, for all food deliveries placed on Zomato for now.

Zomato Gold, the company’s loyalty programme, users will also continue to enjoy the benefits of free delivery according to the terms and conditions present at the time of enrolment.

The company is yet to decide if it will tweak the delivery fee for users.

Zomato's key rival Swiggy allows owners to opt in and opt out of such programmes.

Zomato visibility assurance

Apart from an additional fee, Eternal is introducing additional cost layers to make its offerings stand out from rivals and upping its ante in an increasingly competitive food delivery environment, especially when new players like Rapido are firming up plans to enter the food delivery space and challenge the duopoly of Zomato and Swiggy.

Zomato has also proposed a new visibility assurance plan for brands where brands can pay around Rs 6,000-6,500 each month, for each restaurant identification (RID), and boost rider availability for their business.

“Under this plan, I am asked to pay around Rs 6,000 for every food brand that I operate and I’ll get riders assigned on priority. That will ensure my orders are serviced faster and there is better customer stickiness,” a restaurant owner told Moneycontrol.

The increased visibility plan is still in the rollout stages and has not been proposed to all partners, it will be done in phases over the coming weeks, the owner added.

With this, Eternal is preparing to have an edge over its peers and also ensuring that riders are paid more, a move that will likely deter them from joining rivals, other upcoming companies or quick commerce firms.

Zomato is asking restaurants to pay up more at a time when food delivery growth has largely been range bound, growing 15-20 percent year-on-year (YoY), which has forced companies to implement new measures and capture more market share."
Fintechs hopeful of revival in credit growth after RBI's big rate cut,https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/fintechs-hopeful-of-revival-in-credit-growth-after-rbi-s-big-rate-cut-article-13105336.html,Unknown,"June 09, 2025 / 14:33","There are some concerns about the speed of transmission of lower rates to NBFCs and fintechs, with some expecting this to take a quarter but there are others who expect at least six months","Fintechs, especially in the lending space, are hopeful of a revival in credit growth after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) went for a larger-than-expected 50 basis point cut, bringing down the repo rate down to 5.5 percent.

Most of the fintechs in the lending space cater to the unsecured segment, with small-ticket personal loans accounting for a large share of the portfolio.

On June 6, RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut repo rate by 50 bps to 5.5 percent from 6 percent earlier. Repo rate is the interest rate at which the RBI loans money to commercial banks. The jumbo rate cut comes after two successive rate cuts of 25 bps each in February and April.

“The RBI’s 50 bps rate cut is a strong signal of its intent to support credit-led consumption. Such bold moves have historically been reserved for periods of economic reset and this could mark the beginning of a fresh credit cycle,” said Anup Agrawal, co-founder of Kiwi, a credit card platform on Unified Payments Interface (UPI).

The reduced cost of funds is expected to benefit card issuers, enabling them to expand access and offer more attractive credit products, he said.

In the past 12-18 months, several fintechs have struggled to raise funds as banks found it difficult to get deposits, resulting in a high interest rate regime despite the regulator easing some of the lending norms to ease liquidity.

Many fintech executives attributed the situation to a large amount of public savings going to equity investments.

“Rate cut cycles do lead to a jump in unsecured lending. There is also more margin in the profit and loss account to lend from,” said Prakash Sikaria, founder of UPI and credit app super.money.

Another challenge that fintechs have been facing is the rising non-performing assets (NPAs) in the small-ticket loans. Worried about bad debt, the RBI has nudged financial institutions to slow down the growth in the segment.

Several large private sector banks such as IndusInd Bank and Axis Bank, many NBFCs, and several small finance banks are facing a rise in NPAs.

There are also some concerns about the speed of transmission of lower interest rates to NBFCs and fintechs, with some expecting this to happen in a quarter, while a few others expect this to take six months.

“This should help increase the availability of funds and reduce the cost. However, these actions take some time to trickle down,” said Alok Mittal, co-founder of Indifi Technologies.

However, some founders are still not convinced about the speed of transmission.

“While the rate cut is a welcome signal, it is too early to say if it will actually ease credit access on the ground. Banks may still be cautious in passing on the benefits, especially in co-lending models where operational friction and risk-sharing concerns remain unresolved. Unless transmission improves, fintechs may not see a meaningful impact in terms of easier or cheaper credit,"" said a co-founder of an MSME lending company, who did not wish to be identified.

Some are worried that the RBI’s stance changing from “accommodative” to “neutral” dims the chances of more rate cuts.

“Any further action will depend on how inflation and growth dynamics evolve from here,” said Vijay Kuppa, CEO, InCred Money.

However, one sector that is expected to benefit is the MSME sector.

“There is likely to be increased credit demand from MSMEs, especially in sectors where delays in receivables are a major bottleneck. This is the right environment for financial institutions to double down on digitising their lending operations,” said Raja Debnath, co-founder and CEO at Veefin Group.

India’s MSMEs are grappling with rising input costs, uneven credit access and evolving trade dynamics. While this move supports credit flow, the “neutral” policy stance underscores limited monetary space and a greater reliance on structural solutions.

""SaaS fintechs and NBFCs must now drive credit access through AI-led underwriting and alternative data models. Ensuring this policy transmission reaches micro and underserved businesses will require deeper alignment between digital infrastructure and economic priorities,” said Rohit Arora, CEO and co-founder, Biz2X and Biz2Credit."

The company will use the funds to expand its clinic presence across key cities and further develop its science and AI platform, which supports its diagnostic and care delivery model, co-founder and CEO Rishi Pardal said.

Founded in 2024 by Pardal and Shiva Subramanian, Biopeak provides personalised health services through in-house clinics. Its approach combines molecular diagnostics, high-resolution imaging, and non-invasive testing to assess early signs of physiological changes. The company opened its first clinic in Bengaluru in March 2025.

At the core of Biopeak’s offering is a diagnostic system that includes tests like organic acid profiling, microbiome mapping, salivary cortisol rhythms, and whole-exome functional genomics. These are paired with imaging tools such as MRI, CT, DXA, and ECHO, as well as tissue-level screenings that examine markers like mineral levels, toxin load, and oxidative stress.

“We’re at a rare moment in time- where advances in molecular science, AI, and diagnostic precision now make it possible to understand the body like never before and take highly customised, timely actions to maximise your healthspan. Biopeak, with its deep science and multidisciplinary team of experts, turns insight from your body into action and measurable outcomes. The moment is now to take control of your healthspan—because the tools and the science have finally aligned,"" Pardal said.

Each client typically undergoes over six hours of multidisciplinary consultations, guided by a dedicated health manager and a team of specialists. The resulting health plan is revisited over time and refined through follow-up testing.

Biopeak primarily serves two categories of users: those seeking to improve overall health and performance, and individuals managing chronic or complex conditions that may not be adequately addressed by conventional treatment.

The company is also working with institutions like the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and Longevity India to adapt its models to South Asian health profiles and environments, aiming to improve relevance and accuracy in care.

“As India’s population ages, our greatest opportunity lies in building systems that not only extend life but enhance the years lived in strength, clarity, and purpose. Investing in geroscience, early interventions, and scalable research will be key to ensuring that longevity becomes a foundation for national wellbeing—not a burden on it,"" said Accel's Prashanth Prakash, who is also a mentor to Biopeak and Founding Patron of Longevity India, a platform focused on advancing research and interventions tailored to India’s ageing population."

"Eternal, Swiggy together add over Rs 30,000 crore in market cap this week amid headwinds at Zepto",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/eternal-swiggy-together-add-over-rs-30-000-crore-in-market-cap-this-week-amid-headwinds-at-zepto-13102953.html,Unknown,"June 06, 2025 / 17:39","While Eternal led the charge by adding Rs 20,217.48 crore in market capitalisation, Swiggy added another Rs 10,373.57 crore in market cap this week, NSE data showed. The two companies saw gains during a week when their key rival, Zepto, had a busy week.","Food and grocery delivery companies Eternal (formerly Zomato) and Swiggy together added a whopping Rs 30,590 crore ($3.6 billion) in market capitalisation in just five trading sessions this week from June 2 to June 6, data available on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) at the end of day’s trading showed.

Among the two companies, Eternal led the charge by adding Rs 20,217.48 crore ($2.4 billion) in market capitalisation. Swiggy, on the other hand, added another Rs 10,373.57 crore ($1.2 billion) in market capitalisation this week.

Market capitalisation estimates the company’s value by multiplying the share price into the number of available shares. This week, Swiggy’s share prices increased 12 percent to change hands at around Rs 372 apiece on the NSE. Similarly, Eternal’s share prices were up 8.6 percent this week to trade at Rs 261.9 apiece on the NSE.

The two publicly listed companies, which have been arch rivals for over a decade, saw gains during a week when their key rival, Zepto, had a busy week.

Quick commerce unicorn Zepto, which was earlier slated to go public in 2025, has pushed out its IPO plans into 2026 after investors asked the company to increase revenues and reduce cash burn, Moneycontrol had exclusively reported earlier in the week.

The delayed entry of a third player increases the chances of investors, looking for exposure to the space, to bet on existing companies.

Amid chances of a delayed public market debut, several brands have expressed displeasure with Zepto’s ways of working. Earlier this week, Zepto sent out a memo to its sellers informing them that the platform will now auto-activate ad campaigns for inactive brands, a move that did not go down too well with its partners as it forces them to advertise on the platform.

The auto-activation move came a few weeks after Zepto began testing a ‘swap and buy’ feature which sellers said puts their brands on the backfoot versus other companies.

Zepto also grabbed the spotlight with a flurry of other activities. The Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suspended Zepto’s food license in Dharavi, Zepto’s workers were striking over reduced payout in Hyderabad and the pausing of Zepto Cafe in 44 locations in the Delhi NCR belt have all tipped investor sentiment in the favour of Eternal’s Blinkit and Swiggy’s Instamart.

To be sure, the hiccups at Zepto were not the only reason behind the gains at Eternal and Swiggy.

On June 4, Morgan Stanley initiated coverage on Swiggy with an ‘overweight’ rating which further sent investor sentiment soaring. Morgan Stanley is also part of Zepto’s IPO syndicate, as reported by Moneycontrol earlier.

The brokerage’s investment thesis hinges on three key pillars: Swiggy’s strengthening performance in food delivery, the large and growing addressable market in quick commerce, and a mismatch between investor assumptions on capital outlay versus top line growth.

Morgan Stanley also added that quick commerce, as an industry, will grow to $57 billion by 2030 in size, up from an earlier estimate of $42 billion, which will benefit the entire industry.

Companies were seen capitalising on the growing demand. CLSA, citing Sensor Tower data, said Blinkit and Instamart on a year-to-date (YTD) basis added 9.3 million and 8.2 million weekly active users, respectively.

Zepto and JioMart, on the other hand, added 3.4 million and 3 million active users.

While quick commerce market leader Blinkit continues to cement its position as the top player, Zepto will look to remain the second-largest player in the space and fresh fund infusion to the tune of $700 million from Avenir and General Catalyst will likely help the company grow further. Swiggy on the other hand will look to boost its quick commerce business with profits that it generates from a growing food delivery business.

In the fireside chat with Moneycontrol’s Chandra R Srikanth at the Accel AI Summit on June 4 in Bengaluru, Prakash and Abhishek Singh, Additional Secretary at the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) discussed India’s agenda for staying globally competitive in the AI race.

Prakash said the AI startup ecosystem in India is growing rapidly, but the real unlock lies ahead through voice-first interfaces, scalable infrastructure, and a skilled talent base.

Prakash as well as MeitY’s Additional Secretary emphasised that India’s advantage in engineering talent must be complemented by deep investments in research and development, high-quality datasets, and access to scalable compute infrastructure.

“Voice will be the most natural interface for the next billion users,” Prakash said, highlighting the importance of building AI solutions that can understand and process multiple Indian languages to drive broader adoption.

During the discussion, Abhishek Singh, Additional Secretary at MeitY confirmed that IT companies Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) are investing in Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).

“Given the capability that our Indian IT industry has, and given from what we are hearing about Infosys investing into GPUs, TCS investing into this, they are taking a large-scale training of their team members,” Singh said at the Accel AI Summit.

He added that there is a need for enhancing their capabilities, and he expects cash-heavy IT players to come up with AI products, applications, and use cases in various sectors."

On May 26, Bengaluru-based Groww confidentially filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with markets regulator SEBI (the Securities and Exchange Board of India) under the pre-filing mechanism. Moneycontrol had reported that Iconiq is likely to pump in $150 million in the broking firm’s pre-IPO funding round of $300 million, at a valuation of $7 billion.

The Iconiq investment is coming through its vehicle ISP VII-B Blocker GW Ltd, and the Singapore firm GIC is coming through Viggo Investment Pte Ltd.

Both companies are getting 1.4 percent stake for Rs 867 crore each, in a cumulative fund raise of Rs 1,735 crore, or around $200 million. This values Groww at $7.1 billion.

The pre-IPO round is around $300 million, and another $100 million tranche is coming, possibly at slightly different terms or valuation, according to a source aware of the matter.

Groww, the country’s largest stockbroker by active investors, is likely to take a conservative IPO valuation of $7-8 billion, considering the market sentiment and volatility.

Based on the valuation, a typical 10-15 percent equity dilution could imply an IPO size of around $700-920 million. Details such as total issue size, and the fresh issue and offer-for-sale breakdown have not been disclosed yet.

The Bengaluru-based wealth-tech firm competes with Zerodha and Upstox in online discount broking and offers mutual funds and other financial products. It was last valued at $3 billion in 2021 during its series E round. Its key backers include Tiger Global, Peak XV Partners, and Ribbit Capital.

Groww has around 1.3 crore active investors, far ahead of Zerodha and Angel One, which have 78 and 75 lakh active investors, respectively.

Groww has more than doubled its FY24 revenue to Rs 3,145 crore at a consolidated level. The company’s FY25 numbers are not yet public but are likely to be part of the updated DRHP.

Its consolidated operational profit rose 17 percent to Rs 535 crore in the year that ended on March 2024, compared with the Rs 458 crore it had reported a year prior. Its consolidated revenue for FY23 stood at Rs 1,435 crore.

The one-time domicile tax of Rs 1,340 crore resulted in Groww posting a Rs 805-crore net loss at the consolidated level. Groww moved its registered office from Delaware in the US to Bengaluru during FY24.

Groww’s IPO process is starting at a difficult time for most brokers, as a few regulations have hurt the industry. Negative investor sentiment has also resulted in all four top brokers seeing a third straight month of decline in active investors in April.

Groww saw around 75,000 fewer active investors in April, while the second-largest broker, Zerodha, saw its active investor base decline by more than 55,000.

For Bengaluru-based Zerodha, which pioneered the discount broking / zero brokerage in India, this was the fifth consecutive month of decline in investors. Broking firms are bracing for higher taxes on trading, lower exchange rebates, and stricter restrictions on retail futures and options trading since late last year. Most broking firms could see a 30-50 percent hit to the topline during the second half of FY25.

Angel One, which is listed, reported a 49 percent fall in net profit in Q4FY25, to Rs 175 crore, compared to Rs 340 crore reported in the corresponding quarter in FY24. Consolidated revenue sank 22 percent to Rs 1,056 crore, from Rs 1,357 crore posted in the same period last year."
"Karnataka govt holding regular consultations on bike taxi policy, says Rapido's Pavan Guntupalli",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/karnataka-govt-holding-regular-consultations-on-bike-taxi-policy-framework-says-rapido-cofounder-pavan-guntupalli-13100060.html,Unknown,"June 09, 2025 / 13:41","Guntupalli said Rapido alone accounts for 5 lakh rides in the state, creating 1.5 lakh daily jobs, and that an estimated 8 lakh rides happen in the state across players","Pavan Guntupalli, cofounder of bike taxi startup Rapido, said the Karnataka government is holding regular consultations with the industry to frame a policy framework on bike taxis as the state’s High Court allowed bike taxi operators to continue their services until June 15.

“We are definitely seeing a lot of positive response… the government is being very collaborative in terms of coming up with the rules,” Guntupalli told Moneycontrol in an interaction.

“All the transport department, the IT department, the labour department, all of them have been super helpful to us and they have expressed interest in formalising this segment,” he added.

The court had earlier ordered all bike taxi services in the state to stop by mid-May, unless the government introduced a policy to regulate them. The April 2 order by the same bench had given a six-week window to comply.

However, the court on April 29 extended the deadline for bike taxi operators, including Rapido, to halt operations post June 15 and asked the government to come up with a policy framework for bike taxis.

Justice BM Shyam Prasad passed the order after considering an interlocutory application filed by Roppen Transformation Services Pvt Ltd, which operates Rapido bike taxis.

Roppen said it had urged the Karnataka government in a meeting on April 23, 2025, to bring in a similar policy and noted that the state is currently working on a comprehensive framework for bike taxis.

The company added that its services meet the growing demand for affordable urban transport and that any disruption could affect the livelihoods of six lakh registered riders in Karnataka.

Guntupalli told Moneycontrol Rapido alone accounts for 5 lakh rides in the state, creating 1.5 lakh daily jobs, and that an estimated 8 lakh rides happen in the state across players. He added that this ground reality is being factored in by policymakers.

Apart from Karnataka, Guntupalli said Rapido is actively looking to enter Goa with its full suite of offerings once the state finalises its policy framework.

He noted that Goa’s tourism-driven economy makes bike taxis a relevant and scalable option, citing high bike ownership and tourist footfalls.

“We believe digitising transportation in Goa will help both the captain and the customer… we will be entering with all the categories we have,” he said.

Guntupalli also said Rapido is supporting quick commerce platforms like Zepto as a logistics partner to boost earnings for its captains, especially during non-peak hours.

“We are partnering with quick commerce players. This is clearly done with the intent of enhancing our captain’s earnings,” he said.

On regulatory scrutiny by CCPA for pre-ride tipping, Guntupalli said Rapido operates as a SaaS platform and does not control prices or take commissions.

He also said the company is not aware of any formal notice from the Central Consumer Protection Authority.

Guntupalli said Rapido expects 2X year-on-year growth across its bike taxi, auto, and cab segments in FY25, and aims to maintain profitability after turning EBITDA positive in Q4 FY24.

Rapido reported a revenue of Rs 648 crore in FY24, marking a 46.3 percent increase from Rs 443 crore in FY23. Rapido also significantly narrowed losses — to Rs 370 crore in FY24 from Rs 675 crore in the previous year.

The company is currently present in over 250 cities and is looking to deepen presence in northern India after starting with southern states."

Chief technology officer (CTO) Vivek Gupta and legal head Tushar Tarun have resigned at a time when the startup is eyeing global expansion.

Gupta, who has been with the firm for nearly five days, is expected to leave by June end, while Tarun, who joined a little over a year ago, exits a month later, sources told Moneycontrol.

“Our CTO, Vivek Gupta, who has been an integral part of CoinDCX’s journey for over five years, has decided to move on. Vivek played a pivotal role in building a world-class technology platform and scaling a 200+ member engineering team,” a CoinDCX spokesperson said, confirming the development.

“His efforts were instrumental in establishing a robust global engineering hub that continues to power our growth across India and international markets. We are deeply grateful for his contributions and wish him the very best in his next chapter. We will be announcing Vivek’s successor shortly.”

Entrackr was the first to report the exits.

On the business front, CoinDCX launched virtual digital asset trading platform BitOasis in Bahrain, as a part of its larger Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region expansion strategy, eyeing 30 percent of its revenue from there by 2026. CoinDCX, which has over 15 million users, acquired BitOasis in 2024.

The spokesperson said CoinDCX has see remarkable growth over the past year, both in terms of user base and volumes, and remains bullish on the future of crypto.

“As awareness grows and regulatory clarity improves, we expect continued momentum and broader investor participation in this space. As we gear up for our next phase of growth and international expansion, we are actively ramping up hiring across critical functions and further strengthening our leadership team to support this vision,” the spokesperson said.

According to media reports, the government will release a crypto discussion paper this month to seek feedback and comments from the industry stakeholders in a bid to bring regulations and certainty to the crypto industry."
Titan Capital former partner Bipin Shah's ZeroPearl nears $30-million maiden fund,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/titan-capital-former-partner-bipin-shah-s-zeropearl-nears-30-million-maiden-fund-13098506.html,Unknown,"June 05, 2025 / 09:28","In under a year, ZeroPearl has already written as many as 13 cheques to startups including health-tech venture Curacare, sneaker brand Gully Labs, and AI-powered product experience management startup Catalogus. Another 10 to 12 deals are currently in the pipeline.","Bipin Shah, former partner at Titan Capital and a prominent early-stage investor, is in advanced stages of raising $30 million, or around Rs 250 crore, for his maiden fund at ZeroPearl, sources have told Moneycontrol.

Shah launched ZeroPearl, a micro venture capital fund, in November shortly after exiting Titan Capital, where he was instrumental in backing breakout startups such as Mamaearth, Credgenics, Giva and Citymall.

The new fund is positioning itself as a micro-VC that is sector-agnostic but leans towards segments such as consumer internet, generative AI and software-as-a-service (SaaS).

In under a year, ZeroPearl has already written 13 cheques for startups, including health-tech venture Curacare, sneaker brand Gully Labs and AI-powered product experience management startup Catalogus.

The firm’s average cheque sizes are generally within the Rs 1-6 crore range.

Out of the 13 deals, six have been in health and wellness. Around 10 to 12 more deals are in the pipeline, sources told Moneycontrol, indicating a rapid deployment strategy.

ZeroPearl did not respond to Moneycontrol’s queries. Shah didn’t respond to WhatsApp messages.

ZeroPearl’s $30-million fund closure is coming together at a time when India’s early-stage investing landscape is undergoing a structural shift.

According to Blume Ventures’ Indus Valley Report 2025, as larger seed and multi-stage funds turn increasingly selective — often prioritising repeat or elite founders — a funding gap is emerging for first-time entrepreneurs. This gap is now being filled by a new crop of micro-VCs, typically founded by seasoned operators or former institutional VCs.

India is home to more than 100 such micro-VC funds, many of them launched in the past few years. These firms operate with sharp theses and focus areas, deploying between $100,000 and $500,000 in pre-seed to seed-stage startups, the report said.

All In Capital, a pre-seed fund founded by former UpGrad executive Kushal Bhagia, recently announced the first close of its second fund with a target corpus of Rs 200 crore, underscoring the momentum in this segment.

The micro-VC boom comes even as overall seed-stage funding in India has been on a decline. The Blume report said while early and late-stage funding in 2024 rose by nine percent and eight percent, respectively, to $3.5 billion and $6.6 billion, seed funding dropped 15 percent year-on-year to $1.1 billion.

Still, optimism is returning. As Moneycontrol reported, firms like Accel, Bessemer, Cornerstone VC and Prime Venture Partners have all raised new funds in recent months. Even $100 million-plus deals are making a comeback, especially for growth-stage, IPO-ready startups."
Singapore court declines WazirX’s restructuring plan following $230-mn hack,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/singapore-court-declines-wazirx-s-restructuring-plan-following-230-mn-hack-13096647.html,Unknown,"June 04, 2025 / 19:22",The long-awaited restructuring plan’s approval was critical to allow rebalancing of tokens that would have enabled impacted users to recover up to 85 percent of the value of tokens lost in the initial phase.,"Crypto exchange WazirX’s restructuring plan to return funds of users following its $230-million hack is now in a limbo as Singapore High Court declined the plan on June 4, the exchange shared on X.

This comes a month after the exchange’s moratorium period under the Singapore court ended. Prior to the cyberattack on one of multisig wallets in July 2024, WazirX was India’s largest crypto exchange with at least 33 percent of Indian crypto users either holding balances or accounts with the exchange.

WazirX lost nearly 45 percent of its crypto holdings in this hack.

The long-awaited restructuring plan’s approval was critical to allow rebalancing of tokens that would have enabled impacted users to recover up to 85 percent of the value of tokens lost in the initial phase.

In a post on X, WazirX said, “The Honourable Singapore High Court issued an order declining to approve our proposed restructuring plan. While this outcome was not what we anticipated, we respect the Court’s decision and remain fully committed to complying with all legal and regulatory processes.”

“Our primary focus remains to begin distributions as soon as possible. Towards this goal, we are currently evaluating all available legal options in consultation with our legal and advisory teams, and will be appealing against the decision of the Singapore High Court,” it added.

The exchange added that the decision does not impact its NLPA (Net Liquid Platform Assets), which remain safe.

Meanwhile, as per certain media reports, the exchange had shifted its parent entity from Singapore to Panama and rebranded under a new name, Zensui. The reports suggest that this was to escape ongoing crackdown of crypto exchanges in Singapore offering services outside the country without license.

WazirX operates through two entities, a parent company – Zettai Pte in Singapore and Zanmai Labs in India.

A source privy to the developments told Moneycontrol, that that exchange has not done any such move. “Shifting to Panama was one of the options being explored in our ongoing plans. It's a back up plan. But no such move was made so far,” the source said.

The source added, “WazirX is still awaiting the final order from the court. The current decision was due to a confusion on why Zanmai wasn’t registered under the Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-Ind). But Zanmai is actually an India-registered entity. The exchange is working on its next appeal.”"

This would also see the firm entering the banking segment after acquiring a banking license.,"Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath on June 4 said that the company expects to see a 10 to 20 percent decline in its broking business, as part of its near-term business outlook. Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Kamath cited the slowdown in market activity in the ongoing Q1 FY26 as the reason for the expected drop.

Despite the slowdown in the market and its expected impact, Zerodha is aiming to generate Rs 10,000 crore in revenue by the end of FY26 without altering its brokerage rates, Kamath added.

When asked if the startup currently has any plans for launching its initial public offering (IPO), Kamath said that the firm has enough cash to do whatever they want to do, and there is no need for an IPO. ""We continue to believe there's no reason to IPO. Being listed on exchanges is tough for a company like us,"" he said during an interaction with CNBC-TV18's Shereen Bhan.

Kamath added that the firm intends to stay private as its business model and operational style do not match with the demands of public markets.

The Zerodha CEO reaffirmed the firm's ambitious goal of transitioning into a full-fledged financial services conglomerate in the next decade. This would also see the firm entering the banking segment after acquiring a banking license.

Kamath will soon represent India at the EY World Entrepreneur Of The Year Awards in Monte Carlo. He was named EY Entrepreneur Of The Year 2024 in March this year for his role in reshaping India’s brokerage industry through a low-margin, high-volume strategy. He has not only bootstrapped Zerodha into a billion-dollar company but has also actively supported fintech and climate-focused startups.

The past Indian winners of the EY World Entrepreneur Of The Year title include Infosys co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy, Uday Kotak of Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Biocon’s Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw."
Exclusive: OfBusiness to pick up stake in Bengaluru-based apparel exporter Indian Designs in fifth deal ahead of IPO,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/ofbusiness-to-pick-up-stake-in-bengaluru-based-apparel-exporter-indian-designs-in-fifth-deal-ahead-of-ipo-13093968.html,Unknown,"June 04, 2025 / 13:29","The deal, which is still in process, is expected to strengthen OfBusiness’s presence in the apparel manufacturing space ahead of its planned $1 billion IPO. The investment follows the company’s recent acquisition of Kerala-based Elixir Extracts.","IPO-bound OfBusiness is in advanced talks to acquire stake in Indian Designs Exports Pvt. Ltd, a Bengaluru-based apparel and home furnishing exporter and manufacture with clients like Zara, H&M, IKEA, marking its fifth such deal in four years as it accelerates shift toward a manufacturing-driven model.

The deal, which is still in process, according to people familiar with the matter, is expected to strengthen OfBusiness’ presence in apparel manufacturing space ahead of its planned $1 billion IPO. It may include share swap and cash component, sources tell.

While OfBusiness confirmed its investment into the apparel manufacturing space, it did not share details of the deal with Indian Designs Exports.

The latest deal comes just weeks after OfBusiness acquired Kerala-based Elixir Extracts, expanding its presence in the food ingredients sector. Previous acquisitions include Koeleman India (gherkin processing), Alpine Shoes (footwear), and SMW Ispat (steel).

It now primarily operates across four categories--metals, apparels, agri products and chemicals.

Founded in 2015, the Gurugram-based B2B raw material fulfilment platform OfBusiness has been diversifying beyond its original commodity aggregation business, which is susceptible to intense competition from both organised and unorganised players, by acquiring brands and manufacturers to build private labels and integrated supply chains.

Besides, the trading business across its predominant segments like steel, metals, chemicals, construction material commodities is also exposed to the inherent cyclicality and volatility in prices.

“They have been in raw material trading for the longest, which is margin-constrained, especially in volatile categories like metals and chemicals. All these manufacturing deals are will give them margin stability and value addition,” said a person familiar with the matter.

The strategy is not restricted to Ofbusiness. Its peers like Infra.market, also planning to hit public market, are also pushing their manufacturing or private label play. They recently acquired wood panel –focused manufacturing units besides investments in firms like RDC Concrete, Shalimar Paints, and Emcer.

A Rs 1,200-crore export play

Promoted by Naseer Humayun, Javeed Haroon, and Saad Salman, the three decade-old Indian Designs Exports (IDEPL) manufactures casual garments and home textiles across 12 production units in India and Bangladesh, employing over 15,000 people. In FY24, the company reported Rs 1,246 crore in revenue with an EBITDA margin of 9.85 percent, according to a March 2025 CARE Ratings note.

Exports made up 94 percent of its topline, with a client roster primarily across European and American regions, including H&M, Zara, IKEA, Old Navy, Target, Aritzia, American Eagle, Asos, and Primark, servicing over 25 international buyers across categories.

As of February 2025, IDEPL had an active order book of Rs 253 crore and reported standalone revenue of Rs 738 crore for the first nine months of FY25. Despite cost pressures such as elevated air freight, it maintained EBITDA margins above 6 percent, supported by repeat orders and renegotiated terms with anchor clients like IKEA. The company is likely to cross a revenue of Rs 1,000 crore in FY25, the rating agency notes.

Currently, apparel contributes about 10 percent to OfBusiness's overall revenue--which is likely to be boosted by the latest investment. As per its website, it already caters to global and domestic brands including Zara, Abercrombie & Fitch, Doen, Michael Kors, Uniqlo, Adidas and Skechers--via its aggregator model.

Boosting manufacturing share, IPO prep

Recently, Ofbusiness announced its plans about investing Rs 3,000 crore to double its steel capacity to over 4 million tonnes per annum across its subsidiaries SMW Ispat, Noble Tech Industries, and Shree Sidhbali Ispat. The expansion is expected to increase sectoral EBITDA by 2.5x, co-founder and CEO Asish Mohapatra said earlier this year.

Commerce revenue (excluding lending arm Oxyzo) stood at an estimated Rs 20,000 crore in FY25, with operating profit margins at 2.5 percent. With more integrated manufacturing in the mix, analysts expect gradual improvement in margins. Liquidity remains strong, with Rs 1,641 crore in cash and liquid investments and additional Rs 500 crore in undrawn bank lines.

Backed by investors like SoftBank Group, Tiger Global, Z47, Zodius Capital, Creation Capital, Falcon Edge, and Norwest Venture Partners, OfBusiness has raised Rs 5,370 crore in equity to date.

The company has publicly stated its intent to launch a $1 billion IPO in FY26 to support expansion across its industrial and consumer verticals. Part of this capital is expected to go into its Rs 3,000 crore capex plan to double steel capacity. The firm has already converted into a public entity in January this year--a critical step before IPO--and raised Rs 100 crore debt from Cornerstone Ventures."
"Zepto defers IPO to 2026, seeks private funding from overseas and domestic investors",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/zepto-defers-ipo-to-2026-seeks-private-funding-from-overseas-and-domestic-investors-13094776.html,Unknown,"June 04, 2025 / 12:12","Zepto CEO Aadit Palicha has spent a lot of time in the US in the past couple of weeks to discuss a potential fundraise. Zepto has received term sheets from Avenir Growth and General Catalyst, existing backers, for a potential $700 million round, sources told Moneycontrol.","Quick commerce unicorn Zepto has postponed its initial public offering (IPO) plans by a year and now plans to tap the public markets in calendar year 2026, people aware of the developments told Moneycontrol.

Aadit Palicha, chief executive officer and co-founder, Zepto had earlier said in media reports that the company was confident of going public in 2025.

“That's our ambition...of course, capital markets may change, but for now, we're optimistic that if the business continues to perform as well, we will go public in calendar 2025,"" Palicha told PTI in an interview towards the end of 2024.

However, Zepto is not going to IPO this year, even if it files its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) in the coming months, sources said.

“The plan has been pushed out by a few months a few times now. But it is now almost certain that Zepto will not IPO this year as it works on bringing down its cash burn and improving its profit profile,” the source added.

Zepto did not respond to Moneycontrol’s queries.

The development comes amid media reports that suggest the quick commerce firm missed its revenue and cost targets for Q4FY25 and was now recalibrating its strategy.

Moneycontrol had exclusively reported that Zepto was burning $30-35 million (around Rs 250-300 crore) around November, the burn figure then nearly doubled around the January-February period as the firm responded to an intensely competitive market where Eternal’s Blinkit and Swiggy’s Instamart are both present, as per a second source.

Zepto has also been grappling with higher fixed costs. Zepto’s employee salary bills are at around Rs 100 crore each month, around 80-90 percent of rival Swiggy and 60 percent of Eternal (Zomato), despite having half the workforce, Moneycontrol had exclusively reported earlier.

Other operational issues too are taking up Palicha’s time.

Zepto Cafe paused operations in 44 stores in the Delhi NCR belt and surrounding regions. Apart from that, the company is also weathering a notice form Maharashtra FDA which has resulted in a suspension of services in Dharavi and its delivery partners were also striking at some of its Hyderabad centres.

“With those burn numbers, Zepto knows it cannot IPO because public market investors will not have the comfort especially if its rivals are burning much lesser,” the source said.

“Public market investors will want to see profitable growth before investing in the company, especially when they can now benchmark it against listed players like Swiggy and Eternal.”

Internally, another reason why CEO Palicha is not very keen on going public is because he has seen his rival’s share prices take a beating. Indeed, on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Swiggy’s share price is down around 38 percent to trade at around Rs 333 apiece on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) as on June 4.

At its peak, Swiggy had a market capitalisation of over $18 billion and currently commands a valuation of around $10 billion.

“The better Swiggy and Eternal perform, the better the valuation that Zepto gets – as simple as that. Their valuation falling means even Zepto gets a lower than desired valuation,” one of the persons cited above said.

While Swiggy’s shares have been on a downward trajectory, largely because of mounting losses, the shares of Eternal (formerly Zomato) are up 12 percent on the NSE on a YTD basis. Eternal’s shares have been in favour because the Gurugram-based company has been profitable for eight straight quarters, unlike Zepto and Swiggy.

Despite Zepto’s IPO timeline moving out by a few months, the company is in the advanced stages of completing its IPO syndicate and picking other bankers.

“JM Financial and Motilal Oswal have been added to the IPO syndicate,” a third source in the know said. These two are the additional names apart from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Axis Capital, as reported by Moneycontrol.

JM Financial and Motilal Oswal did not respond to Moneycontrol’s queries.

The company will look to raise around $800 million in its IPO, an increase from an earlier plan of $400-500 million.

Zepto is also finding more comfort in its domestic shareholding pattern, which is another likely reason it is not rushing to IPO. Around 43-44 percent of Zepto is owned by domestic shareholders now and the company is confident it can become a majority Indian-owned firm by the time of its IPO or shortly before it, sources said.

In the interim, Zepto is likely to explore a fairly large private market fundraise from international investors.

Zepto CEO Palicha has spent a lot of time in the US in the past couple of weeks and has held discussions around a potential fundraise from international investors, sources said.

“Zepto could be gearing up to raise as much as $700 million and already has terms sheets from Avenir Growth and General Catalyst,” a third source told Moneycontrol.

Both Avenir and General Catalyst, existing investors in Zepto, have shown willingness to co-lead the round and other existing backers may also up their stake in the company which needs more firepower to fight rivals such as Eternal and Swiggy, the source added.

Avenir Growth and General Catalyst did not respond to Moneycontrol’s queries.

However, nothing is finalised yet and there are chances this round does not materialise if market conditions or if stakeholders decide against such a large fundraise.

While raising more money from international institutional investors may increase foreign ownership in Zepto, the very outcome CEO Palicha has been trying to avoid, it will give Zepto more ammunition to take away more market share from Swiggy, Eternal’s Blinkit, Walmart’s Flipkart, Tata’s BigBasket and more."

OpenAI's Sam Altman predicts AI will start solving complex business problems by 2026,https://www.moneycontrol.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-s-sam-altman-predicts-ai-will-start-solving-complex-business-problems-by-2026-article-13091400.html,Unknown,"June 03, 2025 / 15:36","Sam Altman said that OpenAI's next models which will be released over the next year or two will be 'quite breathtaking', with a lot of improvements across the board.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes that by 2026, artificial intelligence (AI) will be capable of helping businesses solve complex and important problems.

Speaking at Snowflake Summit 2025, he also teased that the company's AI models set to be released over the next year or two will be ""quite breathtaking"", with a lot of improvements across the board.

""Next year, we will be at a point where you can not only use a system to automate business processes and build new products and services, but you can say, 'I have this hugely important problem in my business. I will throw a ton of compute at it if you can solve it,' and the models can figure out things that teams of people on their own can't do,"" Altman said during a fireside chat with Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy. The conversation was moderated by Sarah Guo, founder of venture capital firm Conviction.

Altman said that companies already experienced with such models will be well positioned for a future where they can ask AI systems to ""think hard and redo their most critical project"". ""People who are ready for that will have another big step change next year. For instance, a chip design company can say, 'Go design me a better chip than I could have possibly had before',"" he said.

These comments come after OpenAI reached an inflection point in how businesses were using its AI models sometime last year, according to Altman, leading to strong growth in its enterprise segment.

""As a general principle of technology, when things are changing quickly, the companies that have the fastest iteration speed, make the cost of mistakes the lowest, and the learning rate the highest, win,"" he said.

Ramaswamy echoed a similar sentiment, stating that curiosity is the ""most overlooked thing"" and it's important to keep experimenting.

""I think there's so much that we take for granted about how things used to work that's just not true anymore. OpenAI and Snowflake have made the cost of experimenting very low. You can run lots of little experiments, get value from it, and build on that strength"" he said.

The OpenAI chief expects AI agents to soon help discover new knowledge and said they are already beginning to act like junior employees.

""You hear from companies that are building agents to automate most of their customer support, or their outbound sales and you hear people that talk about their job now is to assign work to a bunch of agents, look at the quality, figure out how it fits together, give feedback, and it sounds a lot like how they work with a team of still relatively junior employees"" he said.

Altman said the work of AI agents is currently in the realm of repetitive cognitive work which can be automated at a low level on a short time horizon.

By next year, he expects these agents to help discover new knowledge in some limited cases or figure out solutions to business problems that are non-trivial.

""As that expands to longer time horizons and higher levels, at some point you can get an AI scientist, an AI agent that can go and discover new science, and that would be a significant moment in the world,"" Altman said.

In January, OpenAI launched its first AI agent, Operator, that can use its own browser to perform repetitive tasks for consumers. This includes filling out forms or expense reports, buying groceries, making restaurant reservations, booking a taxi ride, or making e-commerce purchases among others.

Initially available in the United States, the company extended it to ChatGPT Pro subscribers in India and several other markets like Australia, Brazil, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Canada, and South Korea in February.

In the same month, OpenAI also unveiled Deep Research, an AI agent capable of performing in-depth, multi-step research on the Internet and compiling reports on complex topics. The agent also enables people to connect files from third-party services such as Box, Dropbox, GitHub, Microsoft OneDrive, and SharePoint, for real-time analysis.

Last month, the company introduced a research preview of Codex, a software engineering agent that can work on many tasks in parallel. This includes writing features, answering questions about your codebase, fixing bugs, and proposing pull requests for review among others.

""Codex has been one of my ""feel the AGI"" moments. You watch this thing, give it a bunch of tasks, it goes and works in the background. it can also do these long horizon things"" he said.

Altman further added ""At some point, it'll be able to also watch your meetings if you want, look at your Slack, and read all your internal documents. Maybe, today it is like an intern that can work for a couple of hours, but at some point it'll be like an experienced software engineer that can work for days""

'How far AGI is doesn’t matter'

The OpenAI co-founder also argued that what AGI is and when it will arrive doesn't matter, instead the current rate of progress should sustain well beyond the next five years.

""To me, a system that can either autonomously discover new science or become such an incredible tool for people that our global rate of scientific discovery quadruples. That would satisfy any test of AGI I can imagine"" Altman said.

Ramaswamy also called it as a philosophical question ""I see these models as having incredible capabilities that anyone looking at what things will be like in 2030 would simply declare as AGI""

""I don't think the actual moment matters a whole lot...To me, it's the rate of progress that is truly astonishing. And I sincerely believe that many great things are going to come out of it"" he said.

"Wealthtech platform Stable Money raises $20 million in Series B; pilots mutual funds, loan against FDs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/wealthtech-platform-stable-money-raises-20-million-in-series-b-pilots-mutual-funds-loan-against-fds-13087755.html,Unknown,"June 03, 2025 / 11:43","The round, coming less than a year after its $15 million Series A, was led by Nandan Nilekani’s Fundamentum Partnership, with participation from existing investors Z47, RTP Global, Lightspeed, and new backer Aditya Birla Ventures.","Bengaluru-based wealthtech platform Stable Money has raised $20 million (Rs 173 crore) in a Series B round led by Nandan Nilekani’s Fundamentum Partnership, with investment from Aditya Birla Ventures.

Existing investors Z47, RTP Global, and Lightspeed also participated.

The latest infusion, coming less than a year after its $15 million Series A, will be used to build new products, expand distribution — including offline sales channels — and deepen its fixed-income partner network.

“We are experimenting with debt and gold mutual funds and loan against fixed deposits. Pilots are on. We have already launched curated short-term bonds and secured credit cards,” said Saurabh Jain, co-founder and CEO of Stable Money, in an interview with Moneycontrol. “These products help our customers move beyond FDs at their own pace — we’re building trust first, then expanding their wealth journey step by step.”

Moneycontrol had exclusively reported in February 2025 that Stable Money was in advanced talks to raise $20–25 million, with Fundamentum Partnership expected to lead the round, along with new credit products in the offing.

Founded by former Navi Mutual Fund CEO Saurabh Jain and Harish Reddy in 2022, Stable Money started as a digital fixed deposit (FD) investment platform and later added bonds after securing its Online Bond Platform Provider (OBPP) licence from BSE in early 2024.

“We began with fixed deposits, and we are acquiring users who are first-time investors in wealth tech. This is a segment that doesn’t want negative returns — they want trust and predictability,” Jain said.

“And now we’re building other products on top of that comfort.” Per Jain, 80 percent of its customers availing these ""curated"" corporate bonds come from existing FD customers while the rest are new.

“We launched these (bonds) in October and have been growing, doubling our AUM every month,” Jain said.

The key differentiator, Jain noted, is the focus on short-term bonds. “People are trying with smaller amounts and then slowly scaling to bigger amounts,” he said. “We are offering two-month, three-month, six-month bonds — so they’re able to see the full cycle quickly.”

To further ease access, Stable Money is offering same-day liquidity and lifetime-free demat accounts for bond investors.

The fresh capital will also support pilot initiatives in adjacent wealth products. “We’ll start with debt mutual funds, arbitrage funds, liquid funds, and gold mutual funds— there are mutual funds beyond equity which we want to offer,” Jain said.

Jain added that the platform will eventually offer curated ""DIY-style baskets"" combining FDs, bonds, and mutual funds. “So far it’s very DIY — you come, you choose your FD or bond and go ahead,” he explained. “Now with mutual funds, we’re trying to create baskets. But we won’t do it like a Smallcase or offer recommendations — it will still be configuration templates that users control.”

Tier-2 India and offline reach

While most fintech players chase digitally savvy urban users, Stable Money is focusing on tier-2 towns. “People in these cities have capital — often lying idle in savings accounts or cash — but not access to wealth managers,” said Jain. “They understand FDs, but not digital wealth. That’s where we come in.”

To build trust and drive adoption, the company is planning a physical distribution channel.

“We are trying to set up a very small two-three member team across different cities,” Jain said. “They’ll go talk to customers, explain our products, help them onboard.”

The company has also introduced a secured credit card backed by FDs — particularly useful for users without credit history. “We’ve already sold more than 3,200 cards, and it’s been only a month,” Jain said, adding that traction has been strongest in tier-2 cities. “These customers don’t get unsecured credit cards easily. An FD-backed card makes a lot more sense there.”

Next up, says Jain, is loan-against-FD products within the next quarter. “It will take another three months to go live,” he added.

Currently, the platform has 10 partner banks and NBFCs live, with eight more in the pipeline. “By next June, you should see 18,” Jain said.

Market traction and future goals

Stable Money claims to have more than Rs 3,000 crore in assets under management and over 20 lakh customers. “There is a visible shift in mindset,” Jain said. “People are more open to using tech to manage their money. They’re moving money from savings accounts into investment products.”

Jain believes the company’s real competition isn’t other wealthtech platforms. “Our real competition today is still the LIC agent — the traditional advisor who visits homes in small towns,” he said. “We’re building a digital-first yet trust-led experience that speaks to that audience.”

Mayank Kachhwaha, Principal at Fundamentum, said in a statement: “They’ve blitzscaled from zero to Rs 3,000 crore in AUM and have demonstrated 40% growth in the last three months. With Saurabh and Harish at the helm, Stable Money is well on its way to becoming a full-stack safety net for how India saves.”

Z47’s Vikram Vaidyanathan added, “We are seeing a generational shift in how Indians approach wealth, with a cohort of investors prioritizing long-term compounding of savings over short-term gains. Stable Money has built deep-trust on fixed income products and rapidly emerged as market leaders in a category of the future.""

Aryaman Vikram Birla, Founder, Aditya Birla Ventures said the platform is “well-positioned to serve the evolving financial aspirations of rising 'Middle India’.”

The fintech firm is expanding its leadership team, having hired senior talent across product and business. “Some key roles are hired, and some are still open,” Jain confirmed."

The primary portion was led by 360 One Asset with participation from Ravi Modi, founder of Vedant Fashions, which runs traditional ethnic brand Manyavar, founder Siddharth Dungarwal said on social media on June 2.

Existing investors such as SWC and IvyCap Ventures also participated in the round, which propelled the company's valuation to about Rs 2,500 crore from around Rs 500 crore in December 2023.

Of the Rs 340 crore, Bengaluru-based Snitch raised about Rs 280 crore in primary capital and the remaining Rs 60 crore or so came in the form of secondaries where early investors sold some shares to make way for new ones.

This round comes after Snitch raised Rs 110 crore in its Series A round in December 2023.

Snitch, which some investors say is building the online Zudio, targets the Gen Z crowd, a cohort of users who are more inclined towards fast fashion where design takes precedence over quality.

In fast fashion, where companies like Zara, H&M and Tata's Zudio are active, clothes are typically not repeated several times and are discarded after being used a few times. While some companies are against the idea, the others see a bright future.

Snitch, which rose to fame after raising money on Shark Tank, clocked Rs 243 crore in revenues and generated a profit of Rs 4.4 crore in FY24, according to Tracxn, a private markets data provider. The company is yet to file its FY25 results.

Before the current round, founder Dungarwal had 50.3 percent equity in the company. IvyCap and SWC, which have backed several consumer tech companies such as Meesho, Country Delight, Sharechat and Kuku FM in India, each held 10 percent in the company, Tracxn data shows."
RBI embraces AI to tackle fraud and enhance efficiency,https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/rbi-embraces-ai-to-tackle-fraud-and-enhance-efficiency-article-13067342.html,Unknown,"May 30, 2025 / 11:50","Like every other major institution, the RBI has taken firm steps to deploy and use AI tools with a view to optimising efficiency and effectiveness in its functioning across various departments, and with specific focus on tackling financial fraud and ensuring customer safety","Spread across the Reserve Bank of India’s latest annual report published on May 29, between updates on inflation, liquidity, and financial stability, was a two-letter word that kept surfacing - AI.

Appearing close to 20 times in the document, AI wasn’t just a buzzword peppered in for effect. It was everywhere — embedded in complaints redressal systems, powering fraud detection models, guiding supervisory frameworks, in RBI’s international policy submissions, and even shaping internal workflows through the central bank’s own generative AI tool.

Enter ChiRAG: The brain behind the curtain

ChiRAG, short for Chat Interface with Retrieval Augmented Generation — is the Reserve Bank’s very own generative AI platform. “The potential of emerging technologies, particularly generative AI which can generate context-aware, human-like responses and analyse vast amounts of data, is rapidly gaining traction in the central banking landscape,” the report notes.

ChiRAG, it adds, was initially designed as “a tool for information extraction and synthesis,” but is now being developed further into “a sophisticated orchestration layer, which will seamlessly coordinate with diverse types of information and data associated with the Reserve Bank’s wide array of functions.”

If ChiRAG hints at a shift in how the RBI processes information internally, another effort points to how it wants to engage externally. The Reserve Bank is “collaborating closely with Reserve Bank Information Technology Pvt. Ltd. (ReBIT) to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into the complaint management system in a phased manner.” In Phase I, a conversational AI chatbot will assist complainants, while Phase II will involve “more advanced features for processing the complaints.”

The initiative suggests a regulator thinking deeply about user experience — and reworking redress systems to be faster, smarter, and scalable.

Stopping fraud before it starts

Fraud detection, particularly in the digital payments space, emerged as another priority. “To protect customers from digital payment frauds,” the report notes, “the Reserve Bank constituted a committee to examine various aspects of setting up a Digital Payments Intelligence Platform (DPIP) to harness advanced technologies for the purpose.”

Reserve Bank Innovation Hub (RBIH) has been tasked with building a prototype of the DPIP in consultation with five to ten banks. While the report does not detail the exact role of AI within this platform, the term “advanced technologies” in this context sits comfortably within the bank’s broader AI-led approach to fraud surveillance.

This is not the only project underway. RBIH has also developed a specialised supervised machine learning tool — MuleHunter.ai — to tackle a problem plaguing the digital ecosystem: mule bank accounts. “The model leverages advanced AI/ML techniques to learn patterns of mule account activity from data, achieving higher accuracy as compared to the traditional systems,” the report states. The tool is being tested and deployed in a few large public sector banks, and is aimed at enabling “near-real-time identification of mule accounts.”

Making banks accountable — with data

The Reserve Bank is also building an ecosystem of structured assessments. The Consumer Protection Assessment Matrix (CoPAM) — now being piloted — evaluates regulated entities on metrics like complaint handling time and repeat issues.

Meanwhile, tools like the Supervisory Data Quality Index (sDQI) are enhancing data completeness and consistency. While neither is explicitly marked as AI-led, both reflect the regulator’s shift toward metric-driven supervision that may well support AI integration down the line.

Watching the system, smarter

Beyond customer-facing tools, the RBI is laying the foundation for deeper AI-driven supervision. The report confirms that a dedicated Advanced Supervisory Analytics Group (ASAG) has been set up by the Department of Supervision “for increasing the use of techniques like AI/ML in the supervisory process.”

The group has already developed a suite of analytics models, including microdata analytics, governance assessment, social media monitoring, a fraud vulnerability index, borrowers’ vulnerability model, and an asset quality prediction model. More such models are under development.

These tools aren't just experiments; they mark a shift in how the RBI sees the future of systemic oversight — one powered as much by data as by prudence.

Ethics, adoption and audit: AI governance begins

Perhaps the most telling development, though, is RBI’s attention to the ethical side of AI. In December 2024, the central bank constituted an external expert committee to create a Framework for Responsible and Ethical Enablement of AI (FREE-AI). This framework, due for formulation in 2025–26, aims to guide the responsible deployment of AI in the financial sector. In the same vein, the RBI will also explore the feasibility of adopting AI and ML in internal audit processes, and publish a research paper on leveraging AI to enhance legal functions in the financial sector.

Taken together, these developments show how deeply the institution is embedding AI not just as a set of innovations, but as part of its core governance and compliance strategy.

Mapping the ecosystem, globally and locally

AI isn’t being integrated only by the RBI — it’s also being deployed across the industry. On May 28, 2024, the central bank launched two key repositories: the FinTech Repository, which captures tech stack information from fintech entities, and the EmTech Repository, focused on how regulated entities are using AI, ML, cloud, and DLT.

Both are managed by RBIH, and are designed to help “track sectoral trends and generate analytics that will be useful for both policymakers and the industry.”

And on the international stage, the Department of Economic and Policy Research contributed to global regulatory dialogues under the Financial Stability Board (FSB), including inputs on AI and tokenisation as part of its engagement with cross-border financial innovation and resilience frameworks.

The tone of the report is deliberate discussing through terms like “phased manner,” “pilot testing,” and “collaborative frameworks.” The goal isn’t speed. It’s structural integration.

This year’s annual report may not declare an AI revolution. But it marks something quieter and more consequential: an institutional shift. From regulatory tools like ChiRAG and MuleHunter to frameworks like FREE-AI and fraud detection platforms like DPIP, RBI’s AI playbook is no longer emerging — it’s being implemented.

If AI was once on the regulator’s radar, it’s now on its roadmap."
Ola Electric delays cell integration plan amid push for cost optimisation,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/ola-electric-delays-cell-integration-plan-amid-push-for-cost-optimisation-13069196.html,Unknown,"May 30, 2025 / 11:36","Ola Electric's founder, Bhavish Aggarwal, said the company needs to take a more thoughtful approach to managing operational risks and capital allocation.","Ola Electric has postponed its plan to integrate indigenously developed battery cells into its electric vehicles by a few months, as the company focuses on stabilising its new vehicle platforms and improving manufacturing efficiency.

“We had earlier said that we will bring cells inside our own vehicles this quarter but we have delayed that by a few months,” said Bhavish Aggarwal, founder and chairman of Ola Electric, during the company’s Q4FY25 analyst call on May 29.

“While our vehicles are ready with our own cell, we want to stabilise the Roadster and Gen 3 platform in the market first, and improve commercial production yields from 60% to 80% before we move to using the 4680 cell.”

He also provided updates on other aspects of the business, including a key cost-saving initiative and capex plans.

“Then the second point, again, in the last quarter we spoke a little bit about is our Project Lakshya, which is our cost reduction project. We are largely on track for all those cost reductions, as you can see in the chart in that section. And that savings, that benefit is already accruing to us in our Q1 outlook, as we have shared with you,” he said.

Ola Electric Mobility Ltd on May 29 said its net loss for the March quarter widened to Rs 870 crore from Rs 416 crore in the year-ago period.

The electric scooter maker's revenue in Q4FY25 fell 62% to Rs 611 crore as compared to Rs 1,598 crore in Q4FY24.

With improved cost structures and production efficiencies, Ola Electric expects stronger margins in the upcoming quarters.

“Our gross margin has been going up. Q1 is looking much better already with an outlook of about 28–30%,” Aggarwal said. “In Q2, our gross margin will further increase as we get the PLI benefit. So we are on track to get auto segment EBITDA-positive sometime around June or July.”

The company expects its auto segment to achieve profitability before generating positive operating cash flows.

“For FY26, the auto capex which includes both manufacturing and R&D will be about 150 to 200 crores, since the factory and network are already built, and major R&D on S1 Gen 3 and Roadster platforms is complete. The auto segment should see profitability first and then strong operating cash flows,” he added.

On the battery cell manufacturing side, Ola Electric is treading cautiously before ramping up its capacity.

“So for the cell, there is going to be a total capex of about Rs 1,600 crore, out of which Rs 1,100 crore is debt-financed through existing lines already, and Rs 400 crore or so is equity-financed. The capex will largely go toward expanding from 1.5 GWh currently to 5 GWh,” Aggarwal explained.

Addressing regulatory challenges the company faced in Q4, Aggarwal said the worst is over.

“Q4 had a bunch of issues around regulatory things. Those are now behind us. We had to have trade certificates in some areas. We are now fully in touch with all agencies and state-level RTOs to make sure we are either compliant or have filed whatever is needed,” he said.

“There were also talks around our February sales numbers, which caused confusion. With all regulatory agencies, we have been fully transparent and responsive to their requests. There might still be follow-up queries, but from our side, we don’t see any major business risk from regulatory aspects.”

Aggarwal said the company needs to take a “more thoughtful approach” to managing operational risks and capital allocation.

“We see the need for more mature handling of operating risks. This has been an important learning period for Ola Electric,” he said.

“Last quarter was also a quarter of important learning and introspection. As we’ve transitioned from a private to a public company, we have to manage operating risk more maturely. That lesson has been well learned. Going forward, we are sequencing capital allocation into new products and focusing more on institutionalization of operating processes, especially on the front-end, compliance, and risk.”

Looking ahead, the company has guided for 65,000 vehicle deliveries in Q1 FY26.

“We’ve given a delivery outlook of 65,000 for Q1. We’re new to this outlook stuff, so call it conservative or a median outlook. If we surprise on the upside, you can pat us on the back,” Aggarwal concluded."
